# Gitlab/Hub to Google Colab Integration

+ Do you want to teach a course using a Google Colab Notebook and would you like to pull data from Gitlab or GitHub?
+ Are you teaching using our JupyterHub platform (jhub.dartmouth.edu), but would like to create a backup option?

If you answer yes to either of these questions, you are in the right place.

## Opening your Jupyter Notebook in Colab


1. Upload your Jupyter Notebook to a Google Drive folder of your choosing.
2. Open the notebook from within your Google Drive folder. It will be automatically opened in Colab.
3. Try running your cell(s) that import Python libraries / packages to see if there are any libraries not already installed in Colab.
    a. If the running of these import commands raises any errors, you can insert a cell above the import cell to install the missing packages, for example:
        `!pip install nltk`

## Importing Data into Colab

This remainder of this guide will outline three principle ways to import data into Colab to be used by your students.

## Option 1: Importing Data from Github/lab into Colab


## Option 2: Importing Data from Dropbox into Colab


## Option 3: Have participants download data from you and then upload it to Colab
