# The Reproducible Research Handbook

This directory tree contains all the necessary files to build the Reproducible Research Handbook.


## Getting Started

The book is built using [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/).

Assuming you are in the directory `rr-handbook`, you can install the requirements to build the book like this:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you can build the book by running (mind the dot at the end):

```
jupyter-book build .
```

Open the file `_build/html/index.html` in your browser to view the book.
