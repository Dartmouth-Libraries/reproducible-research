The X-ray absorption near-edge structure shows that the formation of Sv–In2S3@2H–MoTe2 adjusts the coordination environment via interface engineering and forms Mo–S polarized sites at the interface. The interfacial dynamics and catalytic behavior are clearly revealed by ultrafast femtosecond transient absorption, time-resolved, and in situ diffuse reflectance–Infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy. A tunable electronic structure through steric interaction of Mo–S bridging bonds induces a 1.7-fold enhancement in Sv–In2S3@2H–MoTe2(5) photogenerated carrier concentration relative to pristine Sv–In2S3. Benefiting from lower carrier transport activation energy, an internal quantum efficiency of 94.01% at 380 nm was used for photocatalytic CO2RR.

Co-pyrolysis is a promising alternative for transforming this material into solid and liquid products with high added value. This study evaluated how heating rates and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) proportions influence the properties of char obtained by co-pyrolysis. The co-pyrolysis process was carried out using Eucalyptus spp biomass, in three proportions of PET (0, 15 and 25 %) and three heating rates (1, 3 and 5 °C min−1), at a final temperature of 450 °C. We investigated the physical, chemical, energetic and thermal properties of the char produced, which included its morphology via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The average yield of co-pyrolytic char, under all conditions of co-pyrolysis, decreased by 5 % compared to the biomass-only pyrolytic material. In addition to yield differences, the percentage of ash decreased by about 7 % in char with PET. The produced material had a maximum heating value of 32,17 MJ kg−1 and maximum energy density of 4.7 Gcal m−3 (1.10 GJ m−3). These results show the synergistic effect between PET and biomass, pointing to improvements in char generated through co-pyrolysis. The addition of PET in the process, in all conditions investigated, contributed to potentiating the energy characteristics of the material. This co-pyrolysis process can be an alternative for generation and biofuels. The co-pyrolysis of biomass and polyethylene terephthalate is a promising strategy for generating energy products and ensuring the reuse of plastic materials.",Biomass | Circular economy | Plastic waste conversion | Waste plastics,0,0,,,CAPES,14/2023,Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior

In this study, we investigated the antiviral potential of bio-oil (BO) obtained from residual woody biomass of Citrus sinensis. BOs were produced through pyrolysis at different heating rates (1, 3, 5, and 7 °C min−1) and subsequently underwent a purification process. Physical-chemical analyses and identification of chemical compounds were performed using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS). Furthermore, the hemolytic capacity of BOs and their activity against the 3 C L protease enzyme (3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated. The heating rate was found to affect the chemical properties of the BOs, resulting in variations in pH and chemical composition. A total of 23 chemical compounds were identified, with a significant presence of furans, pyrans, and phenolic compounds. Regarding hemolytic capacity, concentrations equal to or below 1% of BOs showed no hemolytic effect. Concerning antiviral activity, the BO obtained at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 demonstrated greater efficacy in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 compared to the BO obtained at a heating rate of 1 °C min−1. This antiviral activity may be associated with the synergistic action of the chemical compounds present in the bio-oils, especially phenolic compounds. These results indicate that the chemical and antiviral properties of BOs can be influenced by the heating rate used during production.

Raw materials and produced CNDs were characterized by several techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), FT-IR, CHNS elemental analysis, diffusion light scattering (DLS), and zeta potential, and the optical properties were studied by spectrofluorophotometry (PL) and UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. The synthesized CNDs exhibited small dimensions, interesting fluorescence behaviour, high stability and remarkable water solubility due to the presence of hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups. Exploiting these properties, CNDs were employed in the development of highly sensitive fluorimetric and electrochemical probes for heavy metal ions, which are of great concern for human health, aquatic life, and environmental sustainability. Hg2+ and Pb2+ were detected by the fluorimetric probe with a limit of detection of 11.3 nM and 78.8 nM, respectively, while the electrochemical platform allowed the selective and simultaneous detection of heavy metal ions, reaching a detection limit of 124 ng L−1 and 551 ng L−1, respectively for mercury and lead ions with high sensitivity, in the range between 11.4 and 34.1 μA nM−1 cm−2",,0,0,,,EC,ECS00000022,European Commission

ZIF-8, experimentally obtained by solvothermal method, was characterized by XRD, FTIR, TGA, BET and its point of zero charge (pHpcz) was determined. Synthesized material showed high crystallinity, with surface area equal to 1558 m2 g−1 and thermal stability equivalent to 400 °C. Adsorption tests revealed, based on the Sips model, that the process takes place in a heterogeneous system. Additionally, intraparticle diffusion model exhibited multilinearity characteristics during adsorption process. Thermodynamic investigation demonstrated that adsorption process is spontaneous and exothermic, indicating a physisorption phenomenon. These properties enable the use of ZIF-8 in oil adsorption, which presented an adsorption capacity equal to 452.9 mg g−1. Adsorption mechanism was based on hydrophobic interactions, through apolar groups present on ZIF-8 structure and oil hydrocarbons, and electrostatic interactions, through the difference in charges between positive surface of adsorbent and negatively charged oil droplets.",Adsorption | Electrostatic interactions | Hydrophobic interactions | Produced water | ZIF-8,1,0,,,,undefined,RUDN University

Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is one of the most versatile technologies for converting renewable biomass feedstocks (especially in the wet state) into biofuel (biocrude oil) in a compact plant. Therefore, this review is devoted to thoroughly reviewing and critically discussing biocrude oil production from biomass feedstocks through the HTL process. This review starts by discussing the principles of biomass HTL processing and product upgrading, aiming to provide a grounded and broad understanding of current developments in this domain. The data reported in the published literature are analyzed and visualized in order to scrutinize the effects of the main process parameters on the quantity, quality, cost, and environmental impacts of resultant biofuels. Higher biocrude oil yields are obtained at temperatures, pressures, and residual times between 300 and 350 °C, 24–27 MPa, and 15–25 min, respectively. Concerning yield and calorific value, biocrude oil derived from homogeneous catalysts demonstrates figures of 23.6 % and 32.1 MJ/kg, whereas that from heterogeneous catalysts exhibits percentages of 66.8 % and 40 MJ/kg, respectively.

The resulting bio-adhesive (SSE/GTE@TA) had a wet shear strength of 0.93 MPa, meeting the Chinese national standard GB/T 9846–2015 (≥0.7 MPa). However, the high polysaccharide content in SSE would weaken the mechanical properties of wood bio-adhesives. The key to improve bio-adhesive quality was the formation of a strong chemical bond via Maillard reaction as well as higher temperatures (140 °C) to reduce polysaccharide content via dehydration. This approach has lower environmental impact and higher economic efficiency compared to incineration and anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge.

Progress in the thermal conversion of short- and long-chain fatty acids into ketenes requires a deep understanding of their interaction mechanisms with the nanoscale oxide catalysts. In this work, the interactions of fatty acids with silica are investigated using a wide range of experimental and computational techniques (TPD MS, DFT, FTIR, in situ IR, equilibrium adsorption, and thermogravimetry). The adsorption isotherms of linear and branched fatty acids C1-C6 on the silica surface from aqueous solution have been obtained.

Irrespective of activity, biomolecules are either physically or chemically adsorbed on the surface. Physical adsorption results from entrapment of the biomolecule or forming layers, while chemical adsorption involves a chemical reaction for tethering biomolecule to surface. The adsorption and consequent activity of biomaterial are influenced by the surface chemistry and biocompatibility of biomaterial surface and biomolecules in order to avoid nonspecific adsorption of biomolecules. Thus, surface chemistry characterizes encouraging directions to specifically engineer its biofunctionality at the biomaterial-cellular interface to control related biological response, without changing overall properties of biomaterial.

Such recovering carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) from waste plastic has been considered as one practical route to achieve a circular economy. Here, we performed a simple pyrolysis-catalysis deconstruction of waste plastic via a monolithic multilayer stainless-steel mesh catalyst to produce multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and H2, which are important carbon material and energy carrier to achieve sustainable development. Results revealed that the C and H recovery efficiencies were as high as 86% and 70%, respectively. The unique oxidation-reduction process and improvement of surface roughness led to efficient exposure of active sites, which increased MWCNTs by suppressing macromolecule hydrocarbons. The C recovery efficiency declined by only 5% after 10 cycles, proving the long-term employment of the catalyst. This catalyst can efficiently convert aromatics to MWCNTs by the vapor–solid–solid mechanism and demonstrate good universality in processing different kinds of waste plastics. The produced MWCNTs showed potential in applications of lithium-ion batteries and telecommunication. Owing to the economic profits and environmental benefits of the developed route, we highlighted its potential as a promising alternative to conventional incineration, simultaneously achieving the waste-to-resource strategy and circular economy.",hydrogen | macromolecule deposition | multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) | upcycling | waste plastic,9,1,publisherhybridgold,Hybrid Gold,,51822604,Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province

Compared with traditional core@shell, COF-based core@shell hybrids own remarkable advantages, including size-selective reactions, bifunctional catalysis, and integration of multiple functions. These properties could enhance the stability and recyclability, resistance to sintering, and maximize the electronic interaction between the core and the shell. The activity and selectivity of COF-based core@shell could be simultaneously improved by taking benefit of the existing synergy between the functional encapsulating shell and the covered core material. Considering that, we have highlighted various topological diagrams and the role of COFs in COF-based core@shell hybrid for activity and selectivity enhancement. This concept article provides all-inclusive advances in the design and catalytic applications of COF-based core@shell hybrids. Various synthetic techniques have been developed for the facile tailoring of functional core@shell hybrids, including novel seed growth, in-situ, layer-by-layer, and one-pot method. Importantly, charge dynamics and structure-performance relationships are investigated through different characterization techniques. Different COF-based core@shell hybrids with established synergistic interactions have been detailed, and their influence on stability and catalytic efficiency for various applications is explained and discussed in this contribution.

Various analytical methods, including TEM, XRD, XPS and N2 adsorption-desorption, were used to characterize both IBOMC and the synthesized catalyst (Ru@IBOMC).

An attractive route is the transfer hydrogenation of furfural using acidic-basic catalysts. In this work, mixed oxides derived from ternary hydrotalcites were employed to obtain furfuryl alcohol from furfural assisted by microwave irradiation. These materials were characterized via X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and the CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) analyses. The lamellar structure of hydrotalcite-type materials collapses during the calcination process, resulting in the loss of carbonate anions and hydroxyl groups, present in the interlayer space. This leads to the formation of mixed oxides that exhibit larger surface areas. Furthermore, these changes alter the basic nature of these materials, giving rise to the formation of strong basic sites. The reaction was studied using containing Co2+ and Ni2+ in their structure and was then optimized using distinct primary and secondary alcohols as hydrogen donor sources, as well as distinct temperatures and initial concentrations of furfural. The yields to furfuryl alcohol are strongly dependent on the type of Me2+ in layered oxides mainly due to higher basicity and to the donor employed in the reaction. The mixed oxide containing Co2+ showed complete conversion of furfural and higher yields to furfuryl alcohol (>95 %) at short times of reaction (<1 h).",biomass | furfural | microwave synthesis | mixed oxides | transfer hydrogenation,0,0,,,CONICET,undefined,Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas

Herein, we present a facile, green, and template-free approach for the one-step synthesis of PtPdCu PNDs by ultrasonication of an aqueous solution of metal salts and Pluronic F127 at 25 ℃, based on natural isolation among nucleation and growth step driven by the disparate reduction kinetics of the metals and acoustic cavitation mechanism of ultrasonic waves.

Therefore, the widespread interest in producing biofuels from microalgae has gained considerable interest among leading energy experts and researchers due to the burgeoning global issues stemming from the depletion of fossil fuel reserves, future energy security, increasing greenhouse gas emissions, and the competition for limited resources between food crops and conventional biomass feedstock. This paper aims to present the recent advances in biofuel production from microalgae and the potential benefits of microalgae in the energy and environmental sectors, as well as sustainable development. Besides, bottlenecks and challenges mainly relating to techniques of cultivation and harvesting, as well as downstream processes are completely presented. Promising solutions and novel trends for realizing strategies of producing biofuels from microalgae on an industrial and commercial scale are also discussed in detail. Alternatively, the role of microalgae in the circular economy is thoroughly analyzed, indicating that the potential of scaling up current microalgae-based production could benefit from the waste-to-energy strategy with microalgae as a key intermediate. In the future, further research into combining different microalgae biomass pretreatment techniques, separating the microalgae feedstock from the cultured media, developing new species, and optimizing the biofuel production process should be carried out to reduce the prices of microalgae biofuels.",Benefits | Biofuel | Bottlenecks | Circular economy | Microalgae,70,0,,,,undefined,

Herein, we synthesized ternary MnFeM (M = Cu, Ti, and Co) active sites doped porous fiber-like g-C3N4 nanostructures (denoted as MnFeM/g-C3N4 NFs) for the efficient HER. This is driven by the sluggish protonation of the melamine monomer in an aqueous solution of ethanol containing ternary metal precursors, followed by carbonization at 550 °C under N2. The as-obtained MnFeM/g-C3N4 NFs were analyzed using various tools which suggest the high-yield of porous ultra-long fiber-like g-C3N4 (3.5-10 μm in length and 70-95 nm in width), with a large surface area (200-250 m2 g−1), and doped with MnFeM atoms (1.7-2.25 wt%).

Besides, theoretical calculations validate that high surface H* coverage over M-FeSi catalyst is conducive to switching the rate-determining step from Ph-NO2* → Ph-NO* to Ph-NO* → Ph-NHOH*, and thus decreasing the total energy barrier of electrocatalytic Ph-NH2 production.",Electrocatalytic hydrogenation | H* intermediate | Neutral medium | Nitrobenzene | Topological FeSi catalyst,9,0,,,NSFC,201602,Scientific and Technological Planning Project of Guangzhou City

The presence of glyphosate in water, the most widely used herbicide worldwide, has triggered alerts owing to the collateral effects it may cause on human health. The main objective of the present study was to investigate the potential of the hybrid material MIL-53(Al)@RH for the adsorption of glyphosate in aqueous solution. The material was obtained following the methodology of MIL-53(Al) synthesis in the presence of hydrolyzed rice husk assisted by microwave. Batch adsorption experiments were carried out to evaluate the adsorbent dosage, pH0 solution effect, contact time, adsorbate concentration, and temperature effect. The results demonstrated that a maximum adsorption capacity of 296.95 mg g−1, at pH0 4 with a ratio of 0.04 g MIL-53(Al)@RH/50 mL of solution, was achieved in 30 min. The Avrami and pseudo-second order models appropriately described the adsorption kinetics and the equilibrium by Langmuir and Sips models. The enthalpy changes (ΔH°) determined propose an endothermic reaction governed by chemisorption, corroborating the kinetic and equilibrium settings. Hydrogen bonds, π*-π interactions, and complexation between the metal centers of MIL-53(Al) and the anionic groups of glyphosate were postulated to be involved as adsorption mechanisms. Finally, for practical application, MIL-53(Al)@RH was packed in a column for a fixed-bed test which revealed that the hybrid can remove glyphosate with an adsorption capacity of 76.304 mg L−1, utilizing 90% of the bed.",Chemisorption | Fixed-bed treatment | Glyphosate | MIL-53(Al) | MOF@Biomass | Rice husk,6,0,,,FCT,undefined,Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia

Herein, we investigate the catalytic transfer hydrogenolysis (CTH) of benzyl phenyl ether (BPE), as a model molecule of α-O-4 lignin linkages, over commercial Ru/C under microwave irradiation using 2-propanol as H-donor. By tuning the reaction parameters, such as time, temperature and catalyst amount, BPE was fully converted, at 150 °C in 5 min of irradiation, with a related aromatics selectivity of 92%. Phenylethylphenyl ether (PPE), and diphenyl ether (DPE), as a models of β-O-4 and 4-O-5 linkages, respectively, were also considered to this scope and under optimized reaction conditions, >99% and 72% conversion, respectively, were achieved with >89% aromatics selectivity. Remarkably, catalytic tests with moderate conversions clearly showed that the cleavage of etheric C-O bond was the primary step under CTH conditions, while the hydrogenations of the aromatic rings take place in a subsequent step. Overall, the screening of the reaction parameters was crucial to avoid the hydrogenation of aromatic rings. No less significant was the Ru/C stability, which has been recycled at least six times without any noticeable activity loss.",,4,0,,,FEDER,PID2019-109953GB,Federación Española de Enfermedades Raras

Nowadays, one of the most fashionable processes is γ-valerolactone (GVL) production from bio-derived methyl levulinate (ML).

A thermodynamic study of the reaction of γ-valerolactone (GVL) production from bio-derived methyl levulinate (ML) is performed by the Gibbs free energy minimization method. The effect of various reaction conditions (temperature, concentration, flow rate) and the implication of possible intermediates and byproducts are assessed. Conversion and selectivity are calculated from the simulation of the ML hydrogenation using isopropanol as the hydrogen donor under continuous flow conditions. Significant increases in GVL selectivity can be achieved under dry conditions, keeping the high conversion. Comparison between theoretical and experimental results from a previous article discloses the effect of using 5%RuTiO2 catalysts, which increases the selectivity from 3–40% to 41–98%.

High basicity and acidity, a high surface area, good thermal resistance, a well-defined pore size, and high nitrogen content constitute the most remarkable features of this carbon and have never been observed altogether in other reported carbons. The dual acid-base characteristic of the designed porous carbonaceous material was verified in the selective one-pot tandem deacetalization-Knoevenagel condensation of acetals with malononitrile, a feature that was attributed to its unique 3D bimodal structure as well as the presence of both strong acidic and basic functional groups in its framework. This material was also employed as a robust acid catalyst in the synthesis of 5-HMF (5-hydroxymethylfurfural) from fructose with 98% yield. IBOMC exhibits excellent bi-functional activity in the conversion of glucose into 5-HMF with 45% yield; this has also been extended to 5-HMF production from sucrose and cellulose.

Benzoic acid derivatives (BADs) are the final products of the selective oxidation of the lignin side chain (i.e., p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, syringic acid, and benzoic acid), with favorable processibility functionality, showing great potential in the synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) containing ester and carbonyl groups. Herein, this tutorial review presents our views on lignin utilization, especially using lignin-based benzoic acid derivatives (LBADs) as raw materials for the synthesis of APIs, with the aim of providing a greener, more eco-friendly approach for providing a sustainable route for the production of APIs. We first introduce the conversion of lignin or lignin platform compounds via the oxidative cleavage of C-C and C-O bonds to LBADs. Subsequently, focusing on the functional group modification strategy for the conversion of LBADs, we raise a “Demand Orientation” concept and several typical API synthesis routes. This tutorial review provides green production routes from LBADs in six instances (i.e., trimebutine, aniracetam, diethylstilbestrol, dopamine, acetaminophen, oxybuprocaine). Finally, several others APIs from LBADs via theoretically feasible and sustainable routes are proposed.

In recent years, PFASs have caused global concern due to their presence in different water and soil matrices, which threatens the environment and human health. These compounds have been reported to be linked to the development of serious human diseases, including but not limited to cancer. For this reason, PFASs have been considered as persistent organic compounds (COPs) and contaminants of emerging concern (CECs). Therefore, this work aims to present the advances in remediation of PFASs-contaminated soil and water by addressing the current literature. The performance and characteristics of each technique were addressed deeply in this work. The reviewed literature found that PFASs elimination studies in soil and water were carried out at a laboratory and pilot-scale in some cases. It was found that ball milling, chemical oxidation and thermal desorption are the most efficient techniques for the removal of PFASs in soils, however, phyto-microbial remediation is under study, which claims to be a promising technique. For the remediation of PFASs-contaminated water, the processes of electrocoagulation, membrane filtration, ozofractionation, catalysis, oxidation reactions - reduction, thermolysis and destructive treatments with plasma have presented the best results. It is noteworthy that hybrid treatments have also proved to be efficient techniques in the removal of these contaminants from soil and water matrices. Therefore, the improvisation and implication of existing techniques on a field-scale are greatly warranted to corroborate the yields obtained on a pilot- and laboratory-scale.",Human exposure | PFASs | Remediation techniques | Short chain | Soil | Water,3,0,,,,PYT235-CONV2019-FCMFQ0018,

Herein, a simple and scalable synthetic protocol is reported for the design of 2D, 3D, and related conducting polymer nanocomposites by interface manipulation in a bicontinuous microemulsion system. In this method, diverse bicontinuous thin layers of oil and water are employed to produce 2D nanosheets of conducting polymers. For the fabrication of 3D polypyrrole (PPY) and their composites, specially designed linkers of the monomers are applied to lock the 3D networks of the conducting polymers and their composites. The technique can be extended to the fabrication of most conducting polymer composites, being cost-effective and easily scalable.

Zeolites are materials that can be synthesized or found in natural rock deposits a with a basic composition consisting in Al, Si, and O. Zeolite’s consideration as a future material is due to many facile synthesis methods to obtain different structures with variations in pore size, surface area, pore volume and physical properties. These methods are developed using the control of relevant synthesis parameters that influences structure formation, such as crystallization temperature, time of aging and/or crystallization, stoichiometric relationships between components of synthesis gel, pH of the medium, and in some cases the type of structure-directing agent. Each method will lead to geometric changes in the framework formation, making possible the formation of typical chemical bonds that are the fingerprint of any zeolitic structure (O-Si-O and Al-O-Si), forming typical acid sites that give specificity in zeolite and allows it to act as a nanoreactor. The specificity is a characteristic that in some cases depends on selectivity, a fundamental property derived of the porosity, mostly in processes that occur inside the zeolite. In processes outside the structure, the surface area is the main factor influencing this property. Moreover, there are many natural sources with adequate chemical composition to be used as precursors. Some of these sources are waste, minimizing the deposition of potential hazardous materials that can be recalcitrant pollutants depending on the environment. Besides its uses as a catalyst, zeolite serves as a support for many bioprocesses; therefore, this review aims to explain relevant aspects in chemical nature, physical properties, main methods of synthesis, main precursors used for synthesis, and relevant applications of zeolites in chemical catalysis and biological processes.",biological applications | catalysis | synthesis | zeolite,10,1,repositoryvor,Green,CAPES,315279/2021-4,Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior

The solids were characterized by X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffraction, nitrogen physisorption, diffuse reflectance UV–Vis spectrophotometry, infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The characterization studies showed that the coupling of TiO2 with fluoride ions promoted the generation of ≡Ti–F surface species that could be responsible for the decrease in the recombination frequency of charge carriers and the increased photoactivity. In addition, it was found that the coupling of NiO/F–TiO2 semiconductors improved the photocatalytic properties of the fluorinated support, obtaining higher percentages of degradation and mineralization of the phenolic contaminant. These results are possibly a consequence of factors such as the formation of larger crystallites, lower band gap energies, and the generation of p-n type interfacial heterojunctions that potentiate the proper separation of electron-hole pairs.

MIL-53(Al)@RH showed high crystallinity in the hybridized MOF particles, thermal decomposition phases, and functional groups (Al–O, O–H, C[dbnd]O, and C[dbnd]C). The hybrid particles allow an easy separation during heterogeneous processing due to their 400 times larger size compared to MIL-53(Al) crystals. The properties of the layered hybrids for removal of Oxytetracycline (OTC), Diclofenac (DCL), and Glyphosate (GLY) in aqueous solutions, were tested by adsorption (ADS) and advanced oxidation processes (AOP). The high ADS capacities (162 mg g−1 GLY, 139 mg g−1 OTC, 93 mg g−1 DCL) and % removal in AOP (97% GLY, 91% OTC, 80% DCL) demonstrated that MIL-53(Al) maintained its properties after hybridization.",Adsorption | Antibiotics | Hybrids | Layered nanomaterials | MOFs | Rice husk,15,0,,,,undefined,RUDN University

Prepared nanocomposite electrolyte material is considered as a novel material owing to the results obtained in terms of improved ionic conductivity, power density, and current density at lower operational temperature. The material has been analyzed as well crystalline material with a dual-phase as confirmed by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). The structural morphology of designed electrolyte materials was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), including high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM). The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) showed a remarkably lower charge transfer resistance than conventional electrolyte materials. Obtained results illustrated that ionic conductivity increased, which lead to the acceleration of the electrode reactions. Heterostructure nanocomposite SZMMY-ZnO is beneficial to attain a high ionic conductivity due to the suppression of electronic conduction through the p-n junction. The maximum power density was noted as 841 mW cm−2 at 550 °C with a maximum current density of 2287 mA cm−2. Based on optical properties through the p-n junction, the internal electronic current was blocked, which further reduced the short circuit problem in the heterostructure. In addition, the performance and lifetime test indicated good stability of the cell at 550 °C with a very small degradation loss.

Moreover, this valorisation method could lead to the formation of value-added compounds such as carbon monoxide, methanol or methane. Thermal hydrogenation is probably the most mature method to achieve this goal. However, this reaction should not be considered only as the reduction of CO2, but must be conceptualised as the conversion of carbon dioxide and hydrogen to value-added compounds and water. In that case, the source of hydrogen cannot be ignored. Due to the high stability of the carbon dioxide molecule, its reduction by thermal hydrogenation requires a catalyst.

Firstly, bare coffee-template titania was prepared to explore the effect of the calcination temperature, within 500–650 °C. The anatase phase was obtained up to 600 °C. Higher temperatures, i.e. 650 °C, led to the appearance of rutile (10%) and efficient removal of the sacrificial agent (0.6% residue). The maximum photocatalytic activity in terms of conversion, in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol, was achieved employing the bare coffee-template TiO2 at 650 °C, and it was found comparable to the benchmarked P25.

After a brief presentation of the use of the main series of MOFs as efficient adsorbents for different types of pollutants, the limitations of these structures related to particle size and hydrodynamic problems during their application are highlighted. Lignocellulosic biomasses are also recognized as an alternative adsorbent, mainly due to their high natural abundance and their low environmental impact during and after their application. The limited capacity of bioadsorbents becomes important in this research. Consequently, the largest amount of information existing in the last ten years on MOF-Biomass functionalization as a hybrid and improvement technology for adsorption processes is compiled, analyzed, compared and contrasted. So far, there is no evidence of works that exploit the concept of functionalization of adsorbents of different nature to give rise to new hybrid materials. Through this review it was found that the hybrids obtained show a higher adsorption capacity (Qe) compared to their precursors, due to the increase of organic functional groups provided by the biomass. Thus, for heavy metals, dyes, Arsenium anions and other organic and pharmaceutical compounds, there are increases in Qe of about 100 mg g−1.

Remarkably, Pd12Ru3/Ni(OH)2/C exhibits a remarkably reduced HER overpotential (16.1 mV@10 mA cm−2 with a Tafel slope of 21.8 mV dec−1) as compared to commercial 20 wt.% Pt/C (26.0 mV@10 mA cm−2, 32.5 mV dec−1). More importantly, Pd12Ru3/Ni(OH)2/C possesses a self-optimized overpotential to 12.5 mV@10 mA cm−2 after 20 000 cycles stability test while a significantly decreased performance for commercial 20wt.% Pt/C (64.5 mV@10 mA cm−2 after 5000 cycles). The mass activity of Pd12Ru3/Ni(OH)2/C for the EOR is up to 3.724 A mgPdRu−1, ≈20 times higher than that of commercial Pd/C.

Herein, several H2O-organic solvent systems were selected for solvolysis of the lignin in wood chips to obtain the lignin oligomers with different structural features. Afterwards, the reaction liquors containing soluble lignin oligomers were employed to produce LNPs via continuous adding H2O. The self-assembly behaviors of the lignin oligomers were strongly influenced by the structural features of the lignin oligomers and the existing organic solvents. From solvothermal extraction in H2O-polar aprotic solvents (e.g. tetrahydrofuran, acetone, and γ-valerolactone), the lignin oligomers with widely-ranged molecular weight could self-assemble into regular-shaped and spherical LNPs, making use of every single space. Besides, the conjugated aliphatic side chains with benzene rings and the abundant negative charged groups of the lignin oligomers favored their self-assembly into LNPs with core-shell structures, and the resultant high electric surface charge prevented further aggregation of LNPs into irregular-shaped clusters. Conversely, the existing polar protic solvents (e.g. ethanol and ethylene glycol) and polysaccharides-derived chemicals, dispersed the lignin oligomers and restrained their π-π stacking induced self-assembly via generating undesirable hydrogen bonds. Therefore, ascertaining the ripple effects of the organic solvents on the whole fabrication process of LNPs benefits to control the morphology of LNPs for various applications.",,11,0,,,NSFC,22078211,National Natural Science Foundation of China

Desiccant air-conditioning (DAC) is an effective method to reduce humidity and energy simultaneously. Conventional desiccants are not suitable for use as a desiccant in building air conditioners, mainly because of high regeneration temperature and other issues such as limited equilibrium capacity and hydrothermal and cyclic instability. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a novel class of porous crystalline materials without the disadvantages of traditional desiccants. They benefit from a huge surface area and considerable pore-volume, very low framework density, and a high-water uptake capacity. In this review article, we have critically and comprehensively discussed the use of MOFs in heat transformation and air conditioning processes. The reasons for the superiority of MOFs over traditional desiccant materials are also discussed comprehensively. Moreover, since thermal conductivity is a key factor in the heat transfer process, an overview has been made on techniques of measuring the thermal conductivity of MOFs. Eventually, several state-of-the-art MOF-based heat transformation applications are reviewed, including heat storage, heat pumps and different desiccant dehumidifiers.",Desiccant dehumidifiers | Heat exchanger | Heat pumps | Heat transformation | Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs),48,0,,,,undefined,

The efficiency of organic waste digestion, nonetheless, is limited due to inhibition and instability. Accordingly, biochar is an effective method for improving the efficiency of AD by adsorbing inhibitors, promoting biogas generation and methane concentration, maintaining process stability, colonizing microorganisms selectively, and mitigating the inhibition of volatile fatty acids and ammonia. This paper reviews the features of crop waste-derived biochar and its application in AD systems. Four critical roles of biochar in AD systems were identified: maintaining pH stability, promoting hydrolysis, enhancing the direct interspecies electron transfer pathway, and supporting microbial development. This work also highlights that the interaction between biochar dose, amount of organic component in the substrate, and inoculum-to-substrate ratio should be the focus of future research before deploying commercial applications.",Anaerobic digestion | Biochar | Biogas production | Crop residue | Renewable energy,44,0,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,RUDN University

In this paper, a biorefinery strategy is proposed at a laboratory scale in order to overcome the issue of the OPW seasonality. OPW was preliminary subjected to a long-term ensiling (up to 12 weeks) with the twofold purpose of preserving the OPW potential for methane production through anaerobic digestion (AD) and stimulating the production of value-added compounds by means of biological (leachate of a previous ensiling process) and chemical (MnCl2) supplements and/or their combination. On the liquid fraction of the ensiled OPW, lactic acid (LA), acetic acid (AA), and ethanol concentrations were detected. Instead, solid fractions were used as substrates for AD both in batch and semi-continuous modes. Specifically, the combined stimulation led to LA and AA yields of 54.5 and 16.6 g kgTS-1, respectively, after 8 weeks, whereas the largest yield of ethanol (i.e., 70.4 g kgTS-1) was achieved after 8 weeks of ensiling without any stimulation.

Accordingly, the variations of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yields and cellulose solubilities of [Bmim][HSO4], [Bmim][H2PO4], and [Bmim]2[HPO4] under different water conditions are experimentally and theoretically studied. Results indicate that [Bmim][HSO4], [Bmim][H2PO4], and [Bmim]2[HPO4] are acid, weak alkaline, and strong alkaline catalysts of transesterification of lipid with methanol, respectively. FAME yields of both [Bmim][HSO4]- and [Bmim][H2PO4]-catalyzed reactions increase initially with the addition of 1.5 g of water, while they decrease with the increase of water content because of the consequent decline of the nucleophilic index and electrophilic index of the OH groups of [Bmim][HSO4] and [Bmim][H2PO4], respectively. Analogously, slight decreases of FAME yields of [Bmim]2[HPO4]-catalyzed transesterification are observed within 0.0-3.0 g of water, while a notable decrease is presented when 6.0 g of water is added. Contrary to the variation of catalytic properties, the cellulose solubilities of [Bmim][HSO4], [Bmim][H2PO4], and [Bmim]2[HPO4] all decrease with the addition of 1.5 g of water, as the water molecules occupy the H-bonding sites of [Bmim][HSO4]-cellobiose (clb), while the H-bonding interactions of water-clb and water-[Bmim][H2PO4] formed by shared oxygen atoms are enhanced with the increase of water content, subsequently enhancing the H-bonding interactions of ILs-clb and relative cellulose solubilities. The variations of cellulose solubilities of ILs with the addition of 0.0-6.0 g of water are opposite to those of their catalytic properties. This study indicates that the cellulose solubilities and catalytic properties of [Bmim][HSO4], [Bmim][H2PO4], and [Bmim]2[HPO4] compete with each other under different water conditions, providing a potential strategy to offset the negative effect of water content on IST of wet algae.",dual roles | in situ transesterification | ionic liquids | microalgae,6,0,,,,KJ2021A0031,Anhui University

This review article describes the advanced research progress during the period of 2008–2021 in graphene-based nanocomposites and discusses their different synthesis methods. We will also talk about the applications of nanocomposite in water splitting, dye degradation, solar fuel generations, and organic transformations. Multicomponent heterojunction structure, co-catalyst cohering, and noble metal coupling have been inspected to enhance the photocatalytic performance of graphene-based composite by increasing charge separation and stability. The photocatalytic system’s remarkable stability has been described in terms of facile recyclability. The adsorption ability of phenolic compounds has been addressed in the form of Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherm with various factors (pH, concentration, the intensity of light, the effect of catalyst, the effect of time, etc.). The purpose of this review is to survey mechanisms and processes that enlist graphene-based composite in terms of efficacy and dose of catalyst required to attain 99% degradation. Nanoparticles may cause toxicity and a pretext for their toxicity has been mentioned. Finally, it is anticipated that this article could allocate consequential knowledge to fabricating graphene-based composites that are in crucial demand of being discussed in future research.

Hydrothermal gasification (HTG) has shown great potential as an effective method for valorizing wet biomass. The high-quality syngas produced using the HTG process can be chemically/biochemically converted to liquid biofuels. Therefore, this paper aims to comprehensively review and critically discuss syngas production from biomass using the HTG process and its conversion into liquid biofuels. The basics and mechanisms of biomass HTG processing are first detailed to provide a comprehensive and deep understanding of the process. Second, the effects of the main operating parameters on the performance of the HTG process are numerically analyzed and mechanistically discussed. The syngas cleaning/conditioning and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis are then detailed, aiming to produce liquid biofuels. The economic performance and environmental impacts of liquid biofuels using the HTG-FT route are evaluated. Finally, the challenges and prospects for future development in this field are presented. Overall, the maximum total gas yield in the HTG process is obtained at temperature, pressure, and residence time in the range of 450–500 °C, 28–30 MPa, and 30–60 min, respectively. The highest C5+ liquid hydrocarbon selectivity in the FT process is achieved at temperatures between 200 and 240 °C. Generally, effective conversion of biomass to syngas using the HTG process and its successful upgrading using the FT process can offer a viable route for producing liquid biofuels.

Since crop residues are by-products of agricultural production, crop residue collection does not compete with food crops for acreage and therefore, it does not negatively impact food prices. Moreover, it has the advantage of reducing the amount of waste, the disposal of which often becomes a serious problem despite natural sources. Biomass conversion becomes a very valid alternative to diversify energy sources and reduce global warming. Thermochemical treatment of biomass is a promising way to convert biomass into bio-oil, biochar, and gas. In recent years, interest in the conversion of plant biomass into biochar has increased because this carbonaceous material has interesting properties that guarantee applications in wastewater treatment, soil improvement, solid fuels, and energy. The processes performed to convert biomass into biochar are different and the most used are thermochemical processes: pyrolysis, torrefaction, hydrothermal treatment, and gasification. The studies of the thermokinetic parameters that control these processes are carried out using different methods that provide the necessary information for the applicability of the processes on an industrial scale. One of the objectives of the present review is to compare kinetic models in order to clarify the role of the conversion process and the effects of the process parameters on the final product. A comprehensive investigation of the thermokinetic parameters controlling the conversion of crop residues to biochar was conducted. The mathematical description of kinetic processes is usually performed using the Arrhenius equation and its derivatives to obtain the activation energies (Ea), the pre-exponential parameter, and the process mechanisms. While isothermal processes can be described using the model fitting method, isoconversional processes can be studied using both the model fitting method and model-free methods. The high complexity and diversity of the reactions involved could lead to the use of approximations. In this paper, an overview of the kinetic parameters determined for biochar production processes and the model used to determine them is given.",,11,0,,,,1381266-R,Universidad de Córdoba

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed that the charge transfer resistance increased for Ba/TiO2, which reduced dark current creation in a dye-sensitized solar cell. The highest power conversion efficiency (3.24%) was achieved for Ba/TiO2 photoanode compared to 2.1% for a pure TiO2 photoanode-based device.",dye-sensitized solar cell | microwave synthesis | nanoparticles | photoanode,2,1,repositoryvor,Green,NU,NU/IFC/INT/01/003,Najran University

The sluggish kinetics of these reaction is a challenging situation on the surface of electrodes which imposes large over-potential and affects the energy output of fuel cells. Although the platinum-based electrode materials have excellent activity toward ORR/OER but their high cost limits commercialization of fuel cells. To deal with this problem, platinum-free electrode materials has aroused the considerations of scientists. The present work is proposed to study the oxygen reduction reaction and water oxidation on the surface of xAg2O-yPrO2/γ-Al2O3/Glassy-Carbon. The ORR was studied electrochemically via cyclic voltammetry on the surface of these nano-catalysts while the OER was investigated via cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry in alkaline media. The mechanism of ORR on catalysts surface was enquired and the results indicate that ORR followed two electrons pathway in case of 10PrO2/γ-Al2O3/Glassy-Carbon while four electrons reduction pathway is identified on surface of others catalysts which divulged that addition of silver with praseodymium shifted the mechanism from 2e− to 4e− pathway. The electrocatalysts featured the stability during multiple scans and no corrosion of electrode in OER/ORR is observed. Different kinetic parameters for both reactions are determined which affirmed that both ORR and OER on the active surface of catalysts is irreversible and diffusion controlled. 4Ag2O-6PrO2/γ-Al2O3 is indicated to be proficient electro-catalyst among other members of the series, having greater value of mass transport and diffusion coefficients.

MSW utilization for recycling is important for transforming the linear economy model into a circular one. The current review analyses and categorises MSW to energy technologies into direct and indirect approaches taking the Circular Economy perspective. The direct approach involves incinerating MSW for heat recovery. The indirect approach, including thermochemical and biochemical processes, is more complicated but attractive due to the variety of the valorized products – such as syngas, bio-oil, biochar, digestate, humus. However, consensus on the best MSW treatment approach is yet to be established due to the inconsistency of assessment criteria in the existing studies. In the case of converting MSW to energy (Waste-to-Energy – W2E), its economic indicators, such as capital, compliance, and operation cost, are important criteria when implementations are considered. In the current work, the critical characteristics of technologies for the MSW to energy routes are scrutinised. In addition, the economic characteristics and the role of MSW in the circular bio-economy is also thoroughly evaluated. Methods to advocate the industrial adoption and important assessing aspects of W2E are proposed at the end of the review to address the environmental and resource management issues related to MSW – most notably dealing with the uncertainty in composition and amounts, the energy efficiency and the resource demands of the W2E processing.",Circular economy | Energy production | Environment management | Municipal solid waste | Waste management,121,0,,,MOST,CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/15_003/0000456,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan"

In particular, the single (aqueous) phase reaction of HMF (0.2 m) carried out for 18 h at 60 °C under 30 bar of H2, allowed the exclusive synthesis of BHMF from the partial (carbonyl) hydrogenation of HMF, while the MP reaction run at a higher T and p (100 °C and 50 bar) proved excellent to achieve only HHD derived from a sequence of hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis. It is worth noting that under MP conditions, the catalyst was perfectly segregated in the IL, where it could be recycled without any leaching in the aqueous/hydrocarbon phases. Finally, the hydrogenation of HMF was explored in a H-Cube® flow reactor in the presence of different solvents, such as ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran, and ethanol.

In total, 10 wt% Zr–TiO2 with average nanoparticle sizes (ca. 4–6 nm) exhibited optimum catalytic activity after optimization of reaction temperature, reaction time, catalyst loading, as well as solvent effect. GVL yield reached 74% with 79% EL conversion at 190 °C for 5 h over 10 wt% Zr–TiO2 in 2-PrOH. The high catalytic activity could be attributed to an appropriate proportion of acidic/basic sites, high Brønted/Lewis acid ratio, and large surface areas. Both acidic and basic sites lead to a synergistic effect on the concurrent activation of H-donor and substrate. The major side product ethyl 4-hydroxypentanoate (EHP) and other byproducts were found. GVL yield achieved from methyl levulinate (ML) and levulinic acid (LA) were 65% and 20%, respectively. Catalyst deactivation was observed due to coke deposits on the catalyst's surface.

The formation of bio-mediated CuO nanoparticles was confirmed by the XRD having crystalline size of 27 nm and monoclinic structure, FTIR presenting absorption band at 673 cm−1. The phase purity was revealed from XRD as there is no extra peak for impurities. The CuO represents the absorption of UV radiations at 380 nm upon UV-DRS studies and band gap energy of 1.48 eV. The morphological studies wereperformed by the FESEM and TEM, both characterized that CuO nanoparticles are spherical in shape. The particle size calculated by particle distribution through FESEM and SEM micrographs was ∼ 25 nm which is in accordance with the crystalline size calculated by XRD. The formation of CuO nanoparticles and phase purity was further validated by the EDX analysis. The metallic existence, phase purity and valency of synthesized nanoparticles confirmed by the XPS. The photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue was studied by CuO under irradiation of visible light. The synthesized CuO degraded the cationic dye in 120 min with the degradation efficiency of 88%. Thus, the proposed work suggests the synthesis of metal oxides nanoparticles via green synthesis is very cost effective and ecofriendly process.

According to several recent studies, nuts and their residues are regarded as valuable natural resources for a nutrition and the other applications. The presence of waste nut residues in nature may lead to the environmental problems. The use of this waste for various applications is a very important issue. Nuts contain precious chemicals, which may be advantageous for preparing (nano)materials for the catalytic purposes. Different parts of nuts such as shell, kernel, extracts, etc. have valuable components, which can be used directly to make a variety of heterogeneous catalysts or as stabilising and reducing agents for nanoparticles. For example, the shell of some nuts is rich in lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose, which can be used as an effective and environmentally friendly supports for the heterogeneous catalysts. The design and application of safer and cheaper catalytic systems for different applications including organic synthesis, hydrogen evolution reactions, oxidation reactions, hydrolysis, degradation of pollutants, etc., are an extreme necessity in which nuts and their wastes can play a significant part due to their excellent chemical properties. Cheaper catalysts comprise of natural compounds such as biopolymers, aluminosilicates, kernel shells, zeolites, diatomites, agricultural wastes (such as bagasse pith, rice husk, smaise cob, coconut shell), nut wastes, etc. These compounds are of natural origin and therefore do not harm the environment. Since they are considered a type of waste, they are also cheap and economical.

In this review, the application of nuts as an efficient supports and green reducing agents for the synthesis of nanomaterials has been discussed.

The photocatalytic performance was remarkably improved as compared to individual components, affording excellent product yields (91%) with almost quantitative transformation of benzyl alcohol. The combination of Fe(III)-Lewis acidic sites and free-base porphyrin photosensitizers within the porous solid material make PorphCat-Fe able to show superior catalytic activity for this transformation. In addition, the MOF can easily accommodate the starting materials inside its mesopores and, thereby, make them easily accessible to active sites.

This contribution discloses the synthesis of two bismuth-based halide perovskites with chemical compositions Cs2AgBiBr6 and Cs3Bi2Br9via a solvent-free mechanochemical process in a ball mill. The obtained perovskite powders were characterized via X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and absorption and photoluminescence (PL) steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopy. Cs2AgBiBr6 was able to absorb more in the visible region (Eg = 2.12 eV) as compared to Cs3Bi2Br9 (Eg = 2.53 eV). Additionally, PL time decays were considerably longer for Cs2AgBiBr6 (τav = 740 ns) with respect to Cs3Bi2Br9 (τav = 0.3 ns). Both photo-systems were employed in the oxidation of vanillyl alcohol to vanillin, an aldehyde derivative, under UV or visible illumination. Moderate values of photocatalytic conversion (15-30%) were observed except for Cs2AgBiBr6 under visible light irradiation, where 95% conversion could be obtained after only 80 minutes of exposition. PL measurements with the fluorescent probe hydroethidine and electron spin resonance (ESR) demonstrated the formation of superoxide radical species (˙O2−) after photoexcitation, with a larger concentration observed for Cs2AgBiBr6 under visible light due to higher absorption and longer lifetime of the photogenerated charge carriers. Time-resolved PL measurements of both catalysts mixed with vanillyl alcohol powder shed light on the oxidation step upon irradiation taking place due to a hole transfer process from the valence band of the catalysts.",,16,0,,,MCIU,IJC2018-037348-I,"Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades"

The hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of anisole specifically represents a model reaction for the conversion of lignin to biofuels through the removal of the aromatic carbon-oxygen bonds. To date, a range of Ni-based catalysts have been reported as highly active systems for the HDO of anisole. However, there has been a substantial lack of consideration given to the environmental characteristics of these catalytic systems, in contrast with the scope of the sustainable production of biofuels. Herein, Ni-based SiO2 catalysts are prepared by a solventless and highly efficient mechanochemistry approach, having a considerably lower environmental impact as compared to standard impregnation methods. Importantly, scrap catalytic converters (SCATs) are employed as co-catalysts, proving the possibility of enhancing the catalytic HDO of anisole, with a scarcely exploited waste material. The results demonstrate that the combined use of Ni/SiO2 as catalysts and Ni/SCATs as co-catalysts remarkably boosts the rate of the conversion of anisole up to more than 50% by achieving an almost complete conversion of anisole in only 40 min instead of at 200 °C and 4 MPa H2.",anisole | biofuels | biomass | catalytic converters | hydrodeoxygenation | lignin | nickel,6,1,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,RUDN University

NiFe2O4 nanocatalysts could be uniformly dispersed on the high-specific-area MoS2 surface, representing a highly efficient, inexpensive, and magnetically recoverable nanocomposite catalyst. The semiconductor property of MoS2 ensures a high electric conductivity, thus enhancing electron transfer between the reductant and the reactant. Furthermore, the strong magnetic characteristics enable its convenient separation from the reaction mixture. NiFe2O4 nanoparticles on MoS2-supported produces multiple electron transfer pathways and overcomes known drawbacks of catalytic methods that use metals alone, endowing long-term cycle stability.

Energy production from carbohydrate materials has recently been of great interest due to the availability, reliability, and abundance of carbohydrate sources. Significantly, the catalytic transformation of waste carbohydrates into furan-based biofuels, specifically 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF), appears to be an attractive solution to the aforementioned energy and environmental issues. The potential of DMF as a renewable fuel is prospective, with its physicochemical properties that are similar to those of fossil fuels. Therefore, the current work focuses on the production of DMF, with the important aspects for enhanced DMF yield being summarized herein. Notably, the significant catalysts derived from zeolite, noble-metal, non-noble-metal, metal-organic framework, and electrocatalytic materials are discussed, alongside their effects in deriving carbohydrates to DMF. Furthermore, the mechanisms of DMF production were clarified too, followed by the scrutinization of the effects from reaction conditions, solvents, and hydrogen donors onto the DMF yield. Finally, the purification process, commercialization potential, and economic feasibility of DMF production were incorporated too, with insightful future directions being identified at the end of our review. This review is expected to advocate DMF production from carbohydrate materials, which could alleviate the energy and environmental problems encountered presently.","2,5-Dimethylfuran | Carbohydrates | Catalyst system | Conversion efficiency | Economic feasibility | Purification | Reaction condition",56,1,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,RUDN University

The growth mechanism of the hollow BiOCl nanocaps is elucidated, and the openings of BiOCl nanocaps can be precisely controlled by fine tuning their growth conditions.

This suggests that BiOCl nanocaps show excellent photocatalytic performance to degrade colored rhodamine B. Furthermore, the BiOCl nanocaps can be also extended in the photodegradation of colorless contaminants in industrial wastewater.

The fluorination of titanium dioxide induced changes in some physicochemical properties of the materials, which contributed to a decrease in surface area and bandgap energy as well as an increase in crystallite size as compared to pristine TiO2. ≡Ti–F species were evidenced to be formed, which could favor charge separation processes. A highest segregation of CuO species in comparison with NiO on the surface of TiO2–F could be formed, which could increase defect sites and decrease the band gap. The formation of a heterojunction between the semiconductors was evidenced, responsible for the observed improvements in photocatalytic properties of the composite materials. The photocatalytic tests evidenced an important degradation of caffeine; however, mineralization was incomplete.

Hydrogen is emerging as a secondary energy vector with ever-increasing importance in the decarbonisation progress. Indeed, hydrogen, a green and renewable energy source, could be produced from steam gasification of plant-originated lignocellulosic biomass. In this current review, key factors affect the hydrogen production yield from steam gasification of plant-originated lignocellulosic biomass, including the design of the gasifier, temperature, pressure, and steam-to-biomass ratio, steam flow rate, moisture and particle size of fed biomass, and catalysts were thoroughly analysed. Moreover, the effects of the abovementioned factors on the reduction of tar formation, which is also a key parameter towards ensuring the trouble-free operation of the reactor, were critically evaluated. More importantly, the separation of produced hydrogen from steam gasification of biomass and challenges over technological, environmental, and economic aspects of biomass gasification were also presented in detail. In addition, this paper is also profiling the prospect of Vietnam in fulfilling its hydrogen economy potential because Vietnam has vast biomass due to its tropical weather and availability of arable land, providing abundant lignocellulosic biomass with 45% of agricultural waste, 30% of firewood, and 25% of other sources. Besides, some primary factors hindering the broad application of biomass for hydrogen production were indicated.

Approaches to produce FeV and FeIV species from FeVIO42– include additions of acid (e.g., HCl), metal ions (e.g., Fe(III)), and reductants (R). Details on applying various inorganic reductants (R) to generate FeV and FeIV from FeVIO42– via initial single electron-transfer (SET) and oxygen-atom transfer (OAT) to oxidize recalcitrant pollutants are presented. The common constituents of urine (e.g., carbonate, ammonia, and creatinine) and different solids (e.g., silica and hydrochar) were found to accelerate the oxidation of pharmaceuticals by FeVIO42–, with potential mechanisms provided. The challenges of providing direct evidence of the formation of FeV/FeIV species are discussed. Kinetic modeling and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide opportunities to distinguish between the two intermediates (i.e., FeIV and FeV) in order to enhance oxidation reactions utilizing FeVIO42–.

There are many reports available on SA nanomaterials in the literature and its uses as adsorbent as a treatment for unsafe wastewater. However, very few reports exist for SA nanofibers as an adsorbent. This chapter describes application of SA-based nanofiber developed by electrospinning for the wastewater treatment. Cadmium metal adsorption rate was obtained around 67.05mg/g under optimal experimental conditions. It was established from the thermodynamic details that the cadmium adsorption process was spontaneous as well as endothermic in nature. Similarly, alginate electrospun membranes exhibited maximum monolayer sorption capacity of 15.6mg/g at pH 4. Similarly, other studies employing alginate nanofibers as an adsorbent showed that removal of heavy metals from the solution followed this trend: Cu>Ni>Cd>Co.

However, most electrocatalysts used in the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) have very limited durability. Herein, a strategy for Pd2+ loading on a specific covalent organic framework (COF) by impregnation is disclosed. Then, high-temperature carbonization is used to convert it into a COF-derived nitrogen-doped carbon (CN) to obtain a series of Pd-CN catalysts with different Pd loadings. Among them, Pd-CN-2 (with 2.51 wt%) exhibits high activity in the MOR and EOR. Its activity in the MOR is 2.93 A mgPd−1 (much more active than Pd/C-0.20 A mgPd−1). In the EOR, it reached 5.44 A mgPd−1, 25 times higher than that of Pd/C (0.22 A mgPd−1). In addition, the catalyst shows superior stability in both the MOR and EOR, maintaining more than 90% of its initial mass activity after a 40 000 s stability test. Its high activity and stability are probably attributed to the extraordinary stability of COF-derived CN materials and the interaction between Pd and CN. This work provides a general synthesis idea of obtaining highly efficient and stable metal-carbon-nitrogen electrocatalysts for application in fuel cells.",,4,0,,,NSFC,20212BCD42018,National Natural Science Foundation of China

The continually growing demand for eco-friendly and sustainable materials pushes automakers and material researchers to consider the ecological importance of their materials during fabricating, recovering, and disposal. Natural fibre-reinforced composites (NFRC) have been introduced into the automobile market substantially over the last ten years due to their renewability, eco-friendliness, recyclability, biodegradability, light weight, better specific strength, good resistance to impact and corrosion, abundantly available, ease of processing, and cost-effectiveness. Due to cost-effectiveness and weight reduction, NFRC is becoming a better replacement for petroleum/synthetic fibres like aramid, kevlar, carbon, and glass fibre-reinforced composites, and the transportation sector has instigated the use of these materials in many applications like car interiors and exteriors, dash boards, bumpers, spoilers, seat covers, and mirror casings. NFRC with nanofillers is gaining more attention in the field of engineering, particularly for automotive, defense, building, and construction applications due to better aspect ratio, larger surface area, and attractive properties. The mechanical, tribological, and thermal properties of plant fibre-reinforced composites can be improved through the incorporation of organic or inorganic nanofillers. The present review profoundly explores the effects of various factors influencing NFRC with nanofillers.

Therefore, greater attention has been devoted into finding the efficient solutions for adsorbing heavy metal ions. This review paper focuses on the synthesis of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from biomass and their application in the removal of heavy metals from aqueous solutions. Techniques to produce CNTs, benefits of modification with various functional groups to enhance sorption uptake, effects of operating parameters, and adsorption mechanisms are reviewed. Adsorption occurs via physical adsorption, electrostatic interaction, surface complexation, and interaction between functional groups and heavy metal ions. Moreover, factors such as pH level, CNTs dosage, duration, temperature, ionic strength, and surface property of adsorbents have been identified as the common factors influencing the adsorption of heavy metals. The oxygenated functional groups initially present on the surface of the modified CNTs are responsible towards the adsorption enhancement of commonly-encountered heavy metals such as Pb2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, Co2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Hg2+, and Cr6+. Despite the recent advances in the application of CNTs in environmental clean-up and pollution treatment have been demonstrated, major obstacles of CNTs such as high synthesis cost, the agglomeration in the post-treated solutions and the secondary pollution from chemicals in the surface modification, should be critically addressed in the future studies for successful large-scale applications of CNTs.",Adsorbents | Adsorption mechanism | Biomass waste | Carbon nanotubes | Functional groups | Heavy metal ions,146,0,,,,undefined,RUDN University

A one-pot direct transformation of aliphatic, aromatic, and unsaturated aldehydes into esters in the presence of oxygen has been carried out over mesoporous organosilica-supported palladium nanocatalyst (Pd-Cyt@SBA-15) under ambient conditions. Pd-Cyt@SBA-15 efficiently catalyzed selectively large-scale conversion of aldehydes into esters in high yields and large turnover numbers (TON = 98,000). Pd-Cyt@SBA-15 nanocatalyst demonstrated excellent reusability and stability and could be recycled up to ten times without loss of significant reactivity.

Additionally, efforts are aimed towards manipulating the size and morphology of crystallite domains in the MOFs, which are aimed at enlarging their applications window. Today’s knowledge of artificial intelligence and machine learning has opened new pathways to elaborate multiple nanoporous complex MOFs and nano-MOFs (NMOFs) for advanced theranostic, clinical, imaging, and diagnostic purposes.

For this purpose, cerium- and ytterbium-based GO/g-C3N4/Fe2O3 composites have been synthesized to explore their properties, especially in charge storage devices such as supercapacitors, and also as photocatalysts for the degradation of carcinogenic dyes from the environment. Physicochemical studies have been carried out using XRD, FTIR, SEM, and BET techniques. Electrochemical techniques (cyclic voltammetry, galvanic charge discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy) have been employed to measure super-capacitance and EDLC properties. Results show that the gravimetric capacitance calculated from GCD results is 219 Fg−1 for ytterbiumand 169 Fg−1 for cerium-based nanocomposites at the current density of 1 A/g and scan rate of 2 mV/sec. The specific capacitance calculated for the ytterbium-based nanocomposite is 189 Fg−1 as compared to 125 Fg−1 for the cerium-based material. EIS results pointed to an enhanced resistance offered by cerium-based nanocomposites as compared to that of ytterbium, which can be assumed with the difference in particle size, as confirmed from structural studies including XRD. From obtained results, ytterbium oxide-based GO/g-C3N4/Fe2O3 is proven to be a better electro-catalyst as compared to cerium-based nanocomposites. Photocatalytic results are also in agreement with electrochemical results, as the degradation efficiency of ytterbium oxide-based GO/g-C3N4/Fe2O3 (67.11 and 83.50% for rhodamine B and methylene blue dyes) surpasses values observed for ceriumbased GO/g-C3N4/Fe2O3 (63.08 and 70.61%).",Cerium oxide | Graphitic carbon nitride | Photocatalytic degradation | Super capacitance | Ytterbium oxide,32,1,repositoryvor,Green,TU,TURSP-2020/109,Taif University

Characterization studies pointed to the presence of well-dispersed and uniform PdO nanoparticles with very small particle sizes.

For example, the oxidative ring-opening of 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) using hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant proceeds in a nonselective manner, resulting in a multicomponent mixture along with the target compound (3-hexene-2,5-dione). In this work, we address the selectivity issue with a simple and efficient approach using zeolitic-imidazolate framework-8 nanoparticles (ZIF-8 NPs) as selectivity mediators on the base of their unique ordered structure. A quantitative conversion of DMF with 85% of selectivity to the target 3-hexene-2,5-dione (in comparison to 27% selectivity in the blank reaction) was achieved in the presence of ZIF-8 NPs, and importantly, under mild conditions (60 °C, and methanol as solvent). Furthermore, computational studies based on the chemisorption models of ZIF-8 demonstrated a plausible explanation of the observed selectivity. This work may pave the way toward the development of alternative and cost-effective strategies to improve product selectivity in biomass conversion with a view of green and sustainable developments in the chemical industry.",furans | metal-organic framework (MOF) | nanoscale MOF | ring-opening | selectivity | zeolitic-imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8),3,0,,,FPI,CTQ2016-78289-P,Family Process Institute

Nevertheless, the huge kinetic barrier of Cu surfaces for the formation of a C-C bond on the path toward C2+products has remained unsolved to date. In this work, inspired by the successful growth of 2D borophene on Cu (111) surfaces [Nat. Nanotechnol., 2019,14(1), 44], we introduce a high density of one-dimensional copper/borophene interface sites for the C-C coupling reaction by using a framework of density functional theory calculations. Cu alone interacts very weakly with CO, while its synergistic interfacial interactions with boron atoms could significantly boost the CO binding strength, thus facilitating C-C coupling. The Cu-boron interface delivers an ultra-low kinetic energy barrier of only 0.42 eV for the CO dimerization step and a thermodynamic potential limiting step of only 0.61 V for the hydrogenation process toward ethanol production, inhibiting the hydrogen evolution reaction. The improved intrinsic catalytic activity can be ascribed to both the synergistic electronic and structural interactions between metal Cu and non-metal B atoms at the interface. Our work predicts an unprecedented family of low-dimensional nanohybrid catalysts towards the efficient electroreduction of CO to ethanol, thus providing a new class of guiding design principles for the broad experimentalist community.",,22,0,,,NCI,DP170103598,National Computational Infrastructure

Higher whey concentrations reduced calcium carbonate purity to nearly 80%. All experiments showed calcite and vaterite fractions, where a whey increment in the media increased calcite content and decreased vaterite content, causing a decrease in crystal size. MICP improved compressive strength (CS) in sand and fly ash. The best CS results were obtained by fly ash treated with 25 W-75 NB (37.2 kPa) and sand with 75 W-25 NB (32.1 kPa).

Different metal precursors (metal saltsversusMOF particles) were studied in order to explore their impact on the ultimate catalytic performance of the doped materials. Importantly, doping levels as low as <1 wt% led to significant catalytic improvements for selective mild oxidation reactions under microwave irradiation in a very short reaction time (3 min). Fe-doped materials (0.175 mol% catalyst) resulted in the highest yields, achieving a maximum conversion of 46% and 100% selectivity in the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, and 61% conversion and 44% selectivity in the production of vanillin from isoeugenol. Results clearly indicated that the incorporation of Zr or Fe into the structure increased the total acidity of the support, which is then translated into an improved catalytic performance toward the studied oxidation reactions. The recyclability (up to 5 reuses without any treatment; although more reuses are possible after regeneration) of the doped catalysts pointed out their true potential applicability in a sustainable manner. Overall, this work demonstrates that the proposed post-synthetic mechano-chemical approach is an effective good alternative for the preparation of metal-doped porous materials, and is remarkably applicable to different doping metals, allowing thus the straightforward preparation of a library of catalysts with specific catalytic properties depending on the metal incorporated.",,2,0,,,MINECO,2017-T1/IND-6025,Comunidad de Madrid

Apparent density, cell morphology, mechanical, and thermal properties were evaluated. Mechanical and thermal properties of the foams improve to a greater amount of polyol in the matrix. Specifically, the best thermal and mechanical properties (274.99 and 7275.91 kPa for compressive strength and Young Modulus, respectively) were obtained with 50% polyol substitution (0.63 RNCO/OH).

Nevertheless, Cr-MOFs are not very common due to complicate synthesis. Cr-MOFs of large linkers are one clear example of synthetic limitations, since their preparation takes place by post-synthetic routes, commonly starting from Fe-MOFs as precursors. Hence, in this work, the direct synthesis of a phorphyrinic chromium-based MOF, Cr-PCN-600 (PCN stands for Porous Coordination Network) under solvothermal conditions is reported. The resulting Cr-MOF exhibits high surface area, permanent porosity, and broad light absorption wavelength range. Interestingly, this Cr-MOF is a highly effective heterogeneous photocatalyst for the selective aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde under visible light irradiation without any additive. Importantly, the Cr-MOF showed good recyclability maintaining its activity for three runs. The present results lay the foundation for both synthesis and applications of Cr-MOFs as robust photocatalysts in advanced organic transformations.

Their structural mobility is also highlighted, since they are complex molecules that can be modified by changing their structure or the elements that compose them to model their size, charge density, redox potentials, acidity, and solubility. Finally, they can be used in substoichiometric amounts and reused without an appreciable loss of catalytic activity, all of which postulate them as versatile, economic and ecological catalysts.

Despite the unique properties that both its components (eggshell, ES, and eggshell membrane, ESM) possess, it is very often discarded without further use. This review article aims to summarize the recent reports utilizing eggshell waste for very diverse purposes, stressing the need to use a mechanochemical approach to broaden its applications. The most studied field with regards to the potential use of eggshell waste is catalysis. Upon proper treatment, it can be used for turning waste oils into biodiesel and moreover, the catalytic effect of eggshell-based material in organic synthesis is also very beneficial. In inorganic chemistry, the eggshell membrane is very often used as a templating agent for nanoparticles production. Such composites are suitable for application in photocatalysis. These bionanocomposites are also capable of heavy metal ions reduction and can be also used for the ozonation process. The eggshell and its membrane are applicable in electrochemistry as well. Due to the high protein content and the presence of functional groups on the surface, ESM can be easily converted to a high-performance electrode material. Finally, both ES and ESM are suitable for medical applications, as the former can be used as an inexpensive Ca2+ source for the development of medications, particles for drug delivery, organic matrix/mineral nanocomposites as potential tissue scaffolds, food supplements and the latter for the treatment of joint diseases, in reparative medicine and vascular graft producing. For the majority of the above-mentioned applications, the pretreatment of the eggshell waste is necessary. Among other options, the mechanochemical pretreatment has found an inevitable place. Since the publication of the last review paper devoted to the mechanochemical treatment of eggshell waste, a few new works have appeared, which are reviewed here to underline the sustainable character of the proposed methodology. The mechanochemical treatment of eggshell is capable of producing the nanoscale material which can be further used for bioceramics synthesis, dehalogenation processes, wastewater treatment, preparation of hydrophobic filters, lithium-ion batteries, dental materials, and in the building industry as cement.",biomedical applications | catalysis | eggshell | eggshell membrane (ESM) | electrochemistry | mechanochemistry | sustainable resources | waste treatment,43,1,repositoryvor,Green,COST,2/0044/18,European Cooperation in Science and Technology

Piperidine derivatives are the major nitrogen-containing intermediates, including 1-piperidinecarboxaldehyde, 1-piperidineethanol, and alkyl piperidines. Catalysts overall improved the formation of N-free products including 1-pentanol and 2-methyl-1-pentanol. Commercial Pd/C provided the highest pyridine conversion rate at 350 °C, while the homemade Ni-Ru bimetallic catalyst provided a prominent denitrogenation activity at 400 °C, leading to the highest 1-pentanol yield as a major denitrogenated product. Conversion of pyridine over the Ni50Ru50/C catalyst led to formation of three major alkyl piperidines (1-ethyl piperidine, 1-methyl piperidine, and 1-pentyl piperidine). These alkyl piperidine intermediates could further be converted into amino and N-free compounds. A kinetic model was developed to mathematically describe the hydrothermal HDN reaction of pyridine over the Ni50Ru50/C catalyst, which clearly captured all data trends and fitted the temporal variation of all major products.

Most catalysts based on bone can be prepared easily by calcination. High-temperature calcination yields highly active catalysts. Heterogeneous catalysts prepared from these renewable sources could also simply be reused and recovered without any important loss of catalytic performance.

Both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis revealed that configurations of major epoxide products were still determined by salen chirality but e.e. values could be improved when tartrate and salen were configurationally identical. Combinations of (R,R)-salen with (R,R)-tartrate usually offered higher enantioselectivities. SBA-15 was satisfactory supporting material due to the high enantioselectivities and recycling yields obtained.

Herein, trifunctional electrocatalysts comprising cobalt nanoparticles uniformly embedded in porous carbon networks were fabricated using a spent tea leaves (STL) template via a one-step carbothermal-reduction strategy at different temperatures. STL played a synthetic dual role in constructing nanocatalysts by acting as efficient scavengers to trap cobalt cations via electrostatic interactions and as carbon sources to generate a porous carbon matrix. Full characterization of the as-synthesized materials revealed the crucial effect of temperature on the crystallinity, surface area, number of surface defects and interfacial charge distribution properties. Furthermore, the trifunctional catalytic activity of the nanoparticles can be finely tuned by varying the carbonization temperature. Co@PC-7 displayed a superior trifunctional catalytic activity exhibiting an excellent performance for hydrogen production with an overpotential of 153 mV (vs. RHE) to achieve 10 mA cm-2, and an impressive bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic activity with an ultralow potential difference between OER and ORR (ΔE = η10 - E1/2) of 0.69 V, which is one of the lowest values reported in the literature for transition metal nanocatalysts. The remarkable performance of Co@PC-7 is mainly ascribed to its unique structural properties, which give rise to highly desirable charge distributions at the metal/carbon electrochemical interfaces to perform efficient trifunctional water splitting electrocatalysis.

Novel ion battery anode materials (NIBAMs) are attracting a growing attention due to the capacity limitation of the classic graphite anodes, which provide low specific- and rate-capacity, and safety issues. Nevertheless, the electrochemical performance of NIBAMs such as the capacity, cyclability, rate capability, voltage profiles, and safety are strongly dependent on the structural and morphological evolution, phase transformation, ion diffusion, and electrode/electrolyte interface reconstruction during charge-discharge cycling and storage. In-depth understanding of the electrochemical process of NIBAMs is essential for optimizing their preparation and application conditions, and exploring NIBAMs. Traditional electroanalytical methods, such as charge/discharge, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy are utilized to research the capacity, resistance, rate capability and cyclability of NIBAMs. Recently, rapid progress and development in hyphenated techniques by coupling with X-ray, electron, scanning probe, optics, neutron, and magnetic techniques have provided extensive insights into the nature of structural evolution and morphological changes of NIBAMs, and electrode/electrolyte interface.

Niobium-loaded materials as well as their respective support displayed a mesoporous nature and the typical structure of SBA-15 materials. The impact of the incorporation of niobium on the aluminosilicate support on the acidic properties was investigated in the alkylation of toluene using benzyl alcohol and benzyl chloride as alkylating agents. The modification of SBA-15 aluminosilicates with Nb particles incorporated a low number of active sites shown to be highly active in alkylation reactions, reaching quantitative conversion in short reaction times (> 10 min), especially for the alkylation of toluene with benzyl chloride, catalysed by Lewis acid sites.

The designed NCs consisted of three components: i) a magnetic core (Fe2O3 nanoparticle), which allowed the recovery and reuse of the NCs, enhancing thus their attractiveness as green catalysts; ii) a catechol-based polymer coating, chosen because of its strong chelating ability towards metal ions, and its potential to be obtained from biomass (lignin depolymerization); and iii) catalytically active metal nanoparticles (Pd and Cu NPs) immobilized via in situ formation onto the polymeric shell. As-prepared Pd-based NCs successfully catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions, achieving yields between 87% and 97% in only 20–40 min depending on the aryl halides and boronic acid derivatives. Similarly, Cu-based NCs exhibited a quite good catalytic efficiency (> 80%) in the synthesis of propargylamines via A3 coupling reaction of phenylacetylene with various aldehydes and amines. Importantly, these NCs presented a good reusability, without significant decrease in efficiency after several cycles. However, the major advantage of the designed NCs is the lower Pd or Cu content (1.5 wt% and 2.6 wt%, respectively) as compared to most of the reported similar catalysts (between 3 – 6 wt% for Pd and > 5 wt% for Cu), which is a key challenge in view of developing cost-effective and environment-friendly catalysts while maintaining a high efficiency.",catechol-based polymers | copper nanoparticles | core-shell nanocomposites | cross-coupling reactions | magnetic nanoparticles | palladium nanoparticles,7,0,,,MINECO,CTQ2016-78289-P,Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad

HTC reactions were performed at temperatures varying from 200 to 260 °C for 1 h with or without the addition of 7.6 wt% ATFS. The ASS concentration was kept constant at 10 wt%. Lower hydrochar yield was always observed at higher temperatures as more organic matter stayed in the aqueous phase post reaction. With the addition of ATFS, the hydrochar yield was increased by 7-18% compared with that without catalyst at different temperatures. Adsorption and acidic sites of nano γ-Fe2O3 probably played a key role during the HTC process. All hydrochars had lower N content as compared to ASS, particularly hydrochars produced with the addition of ATFS. More than half of the energy in ASS was recovered in the hydrochar. ATFS, which stayed with the hydrochar after ASS HTC, favored hydrochar generation by reducing its combustion activation energy.

These concepts have inspired the circular economy vision, which redefines growth through the continuous valorisation of waste generated by any production or activity in a virtuous cycle. This not only has a positive impact on the environment, but builds long-term resilience, generating business, new technologies, livelihoods and jobs.

Furfural (FUR) and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) are surely the most used furan-based feedstocks since their chemical structure allows the preparation of various high-value-added chemicals. Among several well-established catalytic approaches, hydrogenation and oxygenation processes have been efficiently adopted for upgrading furans; however, harsh reaction conditions are generally required. In this review, we aim to discuss the conversion of biomass derived FUR and HMF through unconventional (transfer hydrogenation, photocatalytic and electrocatalytic) catalytic processes promoted by heterogeneous catalytic systems. The reaction conditions adopted, the chemical nature and the physico-chemical properties of the most employed heterogeneous systems in enhancing the catalytic activity and in driving the selectivity to desired products are presented and compared.

Herein, we report an economic and simple strategy to prepare a novel photocatalyst by using eggshell as template and support. Rod-like Copper sulphide (CuS) nanoparticles are uniformly coated on the surface of porous eggshell to form CaCO3/CuS nanocomposite. Under NIR irradiation, the nanocomposite shows a high catalytic activity for 4-nirophenol (4-NP) reduction and strong photothermal ablation behavior against bacteria. A 98% degradation rate can be completed in 15 min, superior to that in the absence of Near-infrared (NIR) light irradiation. Bacterial inactivation ability is also closely related with photocatalyst concentrations and NIR power. A possible mechanism is suggested, which is attributed to the synergistic photocatalytic, photothermal, photodynamic effects. Our study indicates that waste eggshell not only can be used as an efficient support to immobilize nanoparticles, but also can act as reaction resource to provide active carbonate radicals ([rad]CO3−), which play an important role on target degradation molecules.",CaCO 3 | CuS | NIR | Photocatalysis | Water remediation,79,0,,,NSFC,WKJ-2016-2-36,National Natural Science Foundation of China

In this context, the use of noble metals is not practically and economically sustainable and more abundant and stable alternatives are needed. In this contribution we have prepared and tested metal transition based catalysts (namely Ni3N and Ni nanoparticles) for the hydroconversion of levulinic acid (LA) as a model reaction. LA is useful also to produce valuable N-substituted pyrrolidones. Nanoparticles were prepared via a greener synthesis, using urea and metal salts, and have an average diameter of ∼30 nm (as ascertained by XRD and TEM studies). The main product of the levulinic acid hydroconversion was 1-ethyl-5-methylpyrrolidin-2-one. While this product was always the preferred one when Ni was used, Ni3N favoured the formation of the main product only in a shorter reaction time (below 1 h) with very high selectivity (up to 55% conversion), while a secondary product was formed in a longer time. The stability of the catalysts was also tested. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that such a reaction is tested using transition metals and metal nitrides, with very promising results.",,9,0,repositoryam,Green,RSC,RM1802-1846,Royal Society of Chemistry

The optimum conditions were employed under an air atmosphere, exhibiting an 84% FDCA yield in 22 h. Noticeably, a microwave continuous flow approach was also investigated using the optimum conditions, displaying full HMF conversion with 38% FFCA and 47% FDCA yields. Reusability studies revealed the reason for catalyst deactivation to be most likely associated with the deteriorated textural properties after MW batch and continuous flow reactions.

Currently, no diagnostic method is available for identifying patients at risk of VC development; the pathology is detected when the process is irreversible. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) from endothelial cells might promote VC. Therefore, their evaluation and characterization could be useful for designing new diagnostic tools. The aim of the present study is to investigate whether microvesicles (MVs) from endothelial cells damaged by uremic toxin and indoxyl sulfate (IS) could induce calcification in human vascular smooth muscle cells (VMSCs). Besides, we have also analyzed the molecular mechanisms by which these endothelial MVs can promote VC development. Endothelial damage has been evaluated according to the percentage of senescence in endothelial cells, differential microRNAs in endothelial cells, and the amount of MVs released per cell. To identify the role of MVs in VC, VSMCs were treated with MVs from IS-treated endothelial cells. Calcium, inflammatory gene expression, and procalcification mediator levels in VSMCs were determined. IS-treated endothelial cells underwent senescence and exhibited modulated microRNA expression and an increase in the release of MVs. VSMCs exposed to these MVs modulated the expression of pro-inflammatory genes and some mediators involved in calcification progression.

Formation of Ag2S in the nanocomposite was confirmed using XRD, XPS and UV–Vis DRS and photoluminescence (PL) measurement. XRD patterns pointed to the existence of a wurtzite structure for all samples and by silver loading, Ag2S peaks were visualized in the XRD patterns, with increased intensity by rising the Ag content in the solution precursor. EDS and XPS data indicated the presence of sulfur and silver in the form of Ag+ and S2−.

For this purpose, different solid reagents were screened (Na2CO3, BaCO3, Li2CO3, CoCO3, K2CO3 and CaCO3), and the results were compared with other extraction techniques: conventional Soxhlet, ultrasound (UAE) and microwave (MAE). The comparison was carried out based on total dissolved solids (TDS), total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant power (AOP). As-obtained extracts were analysed by gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis (GC and GC–MS) to characterize their composition. In conventional Soxhlet extraction different solvents (water, ethanol and methanol) were tested. It was demonstrated that ethanol provided the best results. Mechanochemical processing resulted in comparable TPC (75.54 GAE g−1 extract) to Soxhlet. Therefore, MCAE is a step forward since, for the same TPC as conventional extraction, the total extraction time (mechanochemical pretreatment and extraction in ethanol) is reduced more than 10 times. The main phenolic compounds present in the extracts were identified as eugenol, methyleugenol and elemicin. Although the results obtained by means of UAE and MAE could be better than those of MCAE, the present study proposes the substitution of conventional extraction by mechanochemistry since the same yields were obtained.",Antioxidants | Bay leaves | Mechanochemistry | Microwave | Phenolic | Ultrasound,39,0,,,ESF,RYC-2015-17109,European Social Fund

The role of each acid site in the selected reaction could be addressed by selective poisoning with different bases (pyridine and 2.6-dimethylpiridine). In general, the deactivation of the active sites by the different bases significantly increased the selectivity towards GVL, completely quenching competitive side reactions, pointing out GVL formation can be promoted by Zr(IV) species according to the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) mechanism.",Acidity | Continuous flow | Methyl levulinate | Zeolite | Zirconium oxide | γ-Valerolactone,23,0,,,FEDER,BES-2017-081560,Federación Española de Enfermedades Raras

The double perovskites or ""elpasolites"" with the formula A2BB′X6 arise as an alternative to avoid the use of Pb, however, not many of the theoretically predicted structures have been synthesized so far due to several synthetic issues, such as, the formation of stable side products. Herein, we report the synthesis of three double perovskites, Cs2AgBiBr6, MA2TlBiBr6 and Cs2AgSbBr6, through a highly efficient and reproducible mechanochemical approach: the high energy ball milling. This synthetic approach does not require the use of organic solvents, so it is a greener method compared to those reported for other double perovskites. The Cs2AgBiBr6 and MA2TlBiBr6 double perovskites were synthesized with high purity as proved by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurements. However, the Cs2AgSbBr6 double perovskite was obtained in mixture with Cs3Sb2Br9, a side product of the reaction. Several attempts to prepare the Cs2AgSbBr6 double perovskite by using other synthetic methods have been unsuccessful due to the low formation enthalpy of the Cs3Sb2Br9 side product and only the hydrothermal method afforded Cs2AgSbBr6 in mixture with other compounds. We believe that the low temperature required in the ball milling synthesis is the key factor that allows the formation of the antimony double perovskite. Cs2AgSbBr6 is a brown powder with a bandgap energy of 1.93 eV as shown with diffuse reflectance measurements. The three powders exhibit a very high stability with no changes at all in the crystal structure after several months of storage at room temperature and ambient humidity.",,65,0,,,MECD,FPU14/05920,"Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte"

Herein, CuO/ZnO/eggshell (CZ/ES) composites were rationally fabricated by using waste eggshell as a template. After a simple deposition and calcination process, the CuO and ZnO nanoparticles were evenly distributed over the surface of the CaCO3. The (photo)catalytic activity and antibacterial properties of the nanocomposites were subsequently investigated. The results showed that the CZ/ES nanocomposite exhibited a superior catalytic reduction and antibacterial activity. The catalytic reduction reaction rate constant Kapp of 4-nitrophenol under the irradiation of UV-vis light was calculated to be approximately five times higher than that obtained in the absence of light irradiation. Besides, the CZ/ES nanocomposite exhibited significant antibacterial property for the destruction of E. coli and S. aureus. The enhanced performance in the (photo)catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol and bacterial disinfection of CZ/ES may be attributed to the strong reactant absorbance capacity, large amounts of reaction sites, and improved separation efficiency of the electrons.

DOX treatments at concentrations of 1.25–5 mg L −1 were carried out in a voltage source with 1.5–5 V. The cathode used was the platinum electrode. The treatment of DOX 1.25 mg L −1 with 10 mmol L −1 NaCl electrolyte using the AuO-TiO 2 @graphite electrode at 5 V and 1 mA was the best methodology to promote its degradation. Also, the modified electrode was efficient to DOX degradation after 17 cycles of reuse. An energy expenditure of 1.11 and 0.2 kWh m −3 were obtained for 3 and 50 mL of treatment, respectively. Fish embryo acute toxicity test with zebrafish (Danio rerio) were performed before and after treatment by EO using NaCl.

The resulting films were characterized to evaluate their physical (thickness, moisture content, water solubility and water vapor permeability), optical (transparency and UV-light barrier), mechanical (tensile strength and elongation at break), antioxidant and antimicrobiological properties Attractive films were obtained for food active packaging applications, as they presented a high antioxidant activity (up to 99%) and total phenolic content, and good barrier properties against water vapor (50% improved of CMC) in the case of CMC-film containing 15% wt. ethanolic extract. Related to optical properties, UV-light barrier effect was increased (almost 100% of protection) avoiding typical lipids oxidation in food systems.

In a preliminary stage, acid leaching was carried out with the kaolin residue with three different durations (1, 1.5 and 2 h) to evaluate the leaching time that provided the highest amounts of silicon and aluminum in the tailings. Molecular sieves were synthesized by the hydrothermal method and calcined at 550 °C to eliminate the surfactant. X-ray diffractograms of the synthesized samples revealed that the sample AM41-2H, obtained from kaolin leached for 2 h (MC7-2H), presented the best structural arrangement due to the presence of 2θ angles close to 2.32°, a specific surface area of 1016 m2·g-1, a pore volume of 0.80 cm3·g-1, and a pore diameter of 3.14 nm, which are characteristic of Al-MCM-41. A sample of AM41-2H was functionalized with 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MTPS) (5 mmol MTPS/g AM41-2H). To eliminate excess unaltered MTPS on the surface of the material, the functionalized aluminosilicate (AM41-2H-F) was subjected to a purification step. The organic functional group that remained in the molecular sieve (-SH) was then oxidized to its corresponding acid group (-SO3H) to form stronger acid sites. Then, the heterogeneous catalyst obtained (AM41-2H-O) was tested in an esterification reaction of oleic acid with methanol and in an esterification reaction of an industrial waste from palm oil refinement (DDPO), which is generated during the deodorization process of palm oil. Both reactions were carried out for 2 h at 130 °C, with a fatty acid/methanol molar ratio of 1:30 and addition of 5% catalyst to the mass of fatty acid. The results obtained revealed that the conversion to esters from oleic acid and DDPO was 99% and 98%, respectively, in contrast to the uncatalyzed reaction, which achieved only 15% conversion. The catalysts used in the reactions were recovered and reused in the same conditions as the initial reactions, which showed conversions in this first cycle of catalyst reuse of 98% for oleic acid and 81% for DDPO, proving the efficiency of the catalyst synthesized from industrial kaolin waste.",Al-MCM-41 | Deodorization waste | Esterification | Waste mining,13,0,,,CAPES,2018/ 212,Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior

Herein, a study of different synthetic routes for the preparation of imidazolones through the cycloisomerization of propargylic ureas under fast, mild, and environmentally friendly conditions with heterogeneous catalysis was undertaken. First, the synthesis were carried out under mild conditions using toluene and acetonitrile as solvents. Silver and gold nanoparticles supported on AlSBA-15 were used as heterogeneous catalysts. The catalysts were prepared by mechanochemical and microwave-assisted techniques. Sequentially, a range of solvents was replaced by the greener ethanol. Finally, all obtained results were combined in order to carry out the reaction using only water as solvent and promoter of the reaction.

In this work, ET rates of recombinant CotA laccases have been drastically improved by an immobilization process on sulfonic group-modified graphitic carbon nitride (Sg-CN) materials. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy revealed that the enzymes undergo striking conformational changes onto graphitic carbon nitride (g-CN), adopting an electrochemically inactive configuration while retain their nativelike structure with a superb ET efficiency on Sg-CN surfaces. In fact, the resulting CotA laccase/Sg-CN biomaterial displayed an ET rate constant of (12 ± 0.5) s-1, the highest value reported to date for a direct electron-transfer reaction of multicopper oxidases attached to carbon-based materials. Importantly, the combined parallel tempering Monte Carlo (PTMC) and all-atom molecular dynamics (AAMD) theoretical calculations proved CotA incorporation in a highly ordered array with an overall positive surface density composed of lysine and arginine domains in contact with net negatively charged Sg-CN surfaces, which promoted a 1200-fold improvement in the free enzyme ET rate constant. An ET pathway has been put forward that takes into account the orientation of CotA laccase on the Sg-CN surface. Additionally, CotA laccase/Sg-CN biomaterial was tested as an amperometric biosensor delivering outstanding bioelectrocatalytic activities in the oxidation of catechol and syringol, which are relevant emerging pollutants. In fact, the sensitivities of the CotA laccase/Sg-CN/ITO electrodes were 0.95 and 0.41 A·M-1·cm-2 for catechol and syringol, respectively, surpassing most of the laccase biosensors reported in the literature.",Biosensors | CotA laccase | Electrochemically active biomaterials | Graphitic carbon nitride | Priority pollutants | Sulfonated graphitic carbon nitride,20,0,,,COST,Actions/fps/FP1306,European Cooperation in Science and Technology

As a consequence, the preparation of these systems needs to be finely controlled in order to achieve the desired activity. The present work presents a detailed investigation of an ultrasound-promoted synthetic protocol for the grafting of β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) onto silica. Truly, ultrasound irradiation has emerged as a fast technique for promoting efficient derivatization of a silica surface with organic moieties at low temperature. Three different β-CD silica-grafted derivatives have been obtained, and the ability of β-CD to direct and bind Cu when CD is bonded to silica has been studied. A detailed characterization has been performed using TGA, phenolphthalein titration, FT-IR, diffuse reflectance (DR), DR UV-Vis, as well as the inductively-coupled plasma (ICP) of the β-CD silica-grafted systems and the relative Cu-supported catalysts. Spectroscopic characterization monitored the different steps of the reaction, highlighting qualitative differences in the properties of amino-derivatized precursors and final products. In order to ensure that the Cu-β-CD silica catalyst is efficient and robust, its applicability in Cu(II)-catalyzed alkyne azide reactions in the absence of a reducing agent has been explored.

First, the role of catalysis in sustainable chemistry is highlighted. Researchers and those working in industry are continually searching for highly active, efficient and stable catalysts. Nanoscience and nanotechnology have undoubtedly contributed to this, and have gone beyond the classic homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, developing catalysts that exhibit unprecedented properties and performances. The mechanisms behind these nano-effects remain unclear, and there is still space for improvement in the design of nanocatalysts. Current design strategies are based on the synthesis of highly active sites at the nanoscale and also on tuning the micro-environment by hosting them in confined spaces in porous nanomaterials. Advanced characterization of nanoparticles is essential to making the design and synthesis more rational. Nano-effects include structural changes and confinement and have a considerable impact on the energy levels, which can alter the physical, electronic and optical properties of nanomaterials. Prominent catalytic applications in sustainable chemistry include the production of bulk and fine chemicals in classic petroleum-based refineries and in biorefineries starting from biomass, carbon dioxide conversion, photocatalytic water splitting, reformation and the development of advanced sensor materials. These applications fields are highlighted as an introduction to the research topics presented in the following chapters.",,16,0,,,,undefined,

Herein, Ag nanoparticle (Ag NP) loaded-eggshell catalysts were successfully synthesized by a simple impregnation method, in which waste eggshells were used as an efficient template and catalyst support. SEM, XRD and ICP-OES results show that a different number of Ag NPs are uniformly distributed on the surface of eggshells, which are defined as Ag1/eggshell (10.8%), Ag2/eggshell (19.9%) and Ag3/eggshell (34.3%) catalysts according to the amounts of loaded Ag NPs. Then, the activity between the three catalysts and the pure Ag NPs was assessed based on the catalytic oxidation of benzene. Our results show that the Ag NP loaded-eggshell catalysts exhibit superior catalytic activity compared with the pure Ag NPs. Considering the balance between the cost and catalytic performance, the Ag2/eggshell catalyst was selected as the optimum research object in the subsequent work. The Ag2/eggshell catalyst calcined at 500 °C exhibited excellent catalytic activity, which is assigned to the unique channel structure of eggshell, good low-temperature reducibility, and high dispersion of particles (sizes effects) on the surface of eggshell as well as the synergetic interaction between the Ag NPs and eggshell. Furthermore, the Ag2/eggshell catalyst exhibited predominant stability even after 200 h of on-stream reaction.

In particular, we found that shaping Aquivion PFSA into micropellets was a good compromise (between powder and macropellets) to maintain acceptable catalytic performances while considerably facilitating the recovery of Aquivion PFSA at the end of the reaction.

The functional groups of Cs and PVA stabilized the CuNPs and, as a result, several properties (e.g. thermal, morphological and liquid uptake) of the final materials exhibited remarkable improvements in terms of stability and catalytic activity. The metallic nature of CuNPs was confirmed by XRD and XPS analyses. From the XRD data, the Cu nanoparticle size was estimated to range from 3 to 7 nm. Moreover, EDS mapping analysis revealed that the CuNPs are homogeneously distributed throughout the hydrogel surface. The Cs/PVA-CuNP hydrogel was found to be an excellent catalyst for the synthesis of 1,2,3-triazoles using phenyl azide and phenylacetylene as model substrates under mild optimized conditions (>90% yield). Reuse studies revealed that this original CuNP-containing catalyst can be employed in at least 5 consecutive cycloaddition reactions without demonstrating a clear loss of efficiency. Moreover, the copper leaching from the hydrogel matrix was negligible during these consecutive reactions under the investigated conditions. The Cs/PVA-CuNP hydrogel could also efficiently catalyze cycloaddition reactions involving different substituted azide and alkyne precursors.",,34,0,,,CAPES,undefined,Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior

The hydrothermal treatment remarkably enhances the strength of the resulting pyrolyzed carbon materials, enabling the facile fabrication of robust monolithic nitrogen-doped porous carbon with the yield of 44.33%. This nitrogen-doped porous carbon exhibits 3-dimensional porous structure which is mainly mesoporous and high surface area. The thin and 3-dimensional self-supported working electrode is made from the synthesized nitrogen-doped porous carbon without using any other current collector or polymeric binder. The hydrogen evolution reaction electrocatalytic activity in 0.5 M H2SO4 reveals the achievement of the low overpotential of ∼220 mV at 10 mA cm−2, a Tafel slope of ∼77 mV dec−1, a nearly 100% Faradaic yield, an excellent stability, and a low charge transfer resistance. The self-supported electrode exhibits higher electrocatalytic activity than the powder-state supported on graphite felt electrode. Its hydrogen evolution reaction electrocatalytic activity is better than that of the reported non-metal heteroatom-doped carbon catalysts and comparable to that of some metal catalysts in acidic media. The use of flour enables the cheap and facile fabrication of carbon electrode with tunable pore sizes and surface areas, making flour-based carbon electrodes highly promising.",Electrocatalyst | Hydrogen evolution reaction | N-doped porous carbon | Steamed bread flour | Yeast,13,0,,,TWAS,21505128,The Academy of Sciences for the Developing World

However, template- and surfactant-free synthesis of monodisperse polymers and carbon nanospheres less than 200 nm is still challenging. In this paper, new polymer nanospheres were first synthesized by a sol-gel method via the polycondensation of phloroglucinol, p-phenylenediamine, and formaldehyde based on the benzoxazine chemistry in the absence of templates and/or surfactants. We proved the formation of a polybenzoxazine structure and found that p-phenylenediamine not only participates in the condensation but also catalyzes the polymerization of phloroglucinol and formaldehyde based on the characterization by FTIR, Raman, NMR, and XPS. The monodisperse polymer nanospheres are so uniform that they can form three-dimensional periodic structures by self-assembly. In addition, these polymer nanospheres can be pseudomorphically converted to the corresponding uniform nitrogen-doped carbon spheres by pyrolysis due to the excellent thermal stability (48.6 wt% at 1000 °C based on the measurement of TGA) of such polybenzoxazine-based polymers. The high nitrogen doping level of 9.77 wt% in the carbon matrix was achieved. The sizes of the polymer and carbon nanospheres can be adjusted, respectively, in the range of 105-186 and 79.2-137 nm by changing the concentration of monomers and the ratio of ethanol to water.

Chemical intermediates generated after EO were determined by mass spectrometry and their resulting antimicrobial activity was evaluated. AMX did not induce significant mortality in zebrafish during extended exposure but affected zebrafish development (increased body length) from 6.25 mg/L to 25 mg/L and inhibited enzymatic biomarkers. Carbon modified with titanium oxide (TiO2@C) anode achieved complete AMX removal in just a few minutes and efficiency of the supported electrolytes occurred in the following order: 0.1 M NaCl > 0.1 M Na2SO4 > 0.01 M NaCl > tap water. The order of potential toxicity to zebrafish early life-stages related to lethal and sublethal effects was as follows: 0.1 M Na2SO4 > 0.1 M NaCl >0.01 M NaCl = tap water.

Additionally, they are widely used in various organic synthesis reactions. Objective: This contribution has been aimed to provide a compilation of the application of hydrotalcites as basic materials in organic synthesis, with a particular emphasis on multicomponent reactions. Conclusion: Hydrotalcites act as heterogeneous catalysts that conduct highly efficient processes in short reaction times and with the advantage of their easy recovery and reuse without significant loss of their catalytic activity.

The fractionation of lignocellulose is considered to be the fundamental step to establish an economical and sustainable lignocellulosic biorefinery. In this Minireview, we summarize a newly developed oxygen delignification for lignocellulose fractionation called cooking with active oxygen and solid alkali (CAOSA), which can fractionate lignocellulose into its constituents and maintain its processable form. In the CAOSA approach, environmentally friendly chemicals are applied instead of undesirable chemicals such as strong alkalis and sulfides. Notably, the alkali recovery for this process promises to be relatively simple and does not require causticizing or sintering. These features make the CAOSA process an alternative for both lignocellulose fractionation and biomass pretreatment. The advantages and challenges of CAOSA are also discussed to provide a comprehensive perspective with respect to existing strategies.",active oxygen | biomass | fractionation | lignocellulose | solid alkali,36,0,,,NSFC,2015489,National Natural Science Foundation of China

Finding alternatives and more sustainable ways to live, in general, is our duty to pass on to future generations, and one of these important messages relates to waste. Waste from different types (e.g., agricultural, food, industrial) is generated day by day in extensive 24quantities, generating a significant problem in its management and disposal. A widespread feeling of “environment in danger” has been present everywhere in our society in recent years, which, however, has not yet crystallized in a general consensus of cutting waste production in our daily lives. Many methods could achieve sustainable development, methods that could not only improve waste management but could also lead to the production of industrially important chemicals, materials, and fuels, in essence, valuable end products from waste.",,7,0,,,,undefined,

The aim of this work is to test the involvement of microvesicles (MVs) produced by senescent endothelial cells (EC) and from plasma of elderly people in vascular calcification. The present work shows that MVs produced by senescent cultured ECs, plus those found in the plasma of elderly subjects, promote calcification in vascular smooth muscle cells. Only MVs from senescent ECs, and from elderly subjects' plasma, induced calcification. This ability correlated with these types of MVs' carriage of: a) increased quantities of annexins (which might act as nucleation sites for calcification), b) increased quantities of bone-morphogenic protein, and c) larger Ca contents. The MVs of senescent, cultured ECs, and those present in the plasma of elderly subjects, promote vascular calcification.

However, chlorine as a disinfectant is capable of reacting with inorganic and organic constituents of water to produce hazardous chlorinated disinfection byproducts (Cl-DBPs). Brominated and iodinated DBPs (Br-DBPs and I-DBPs), which are more genotoxic and cytotoxic than their chlorinated analogs, may also be formed in the presence of bromide (Br−) and iodide (I−) in water. This paper first reviews the formation of Cl-DBPs and Br-DBPs by considering the rates of the reactions of chlorine with natural organic matter (NOM) and its model compounds. The reactions of chlorine with Br− and I− yield acids (HOBr/OBr− and HOI/OI−, respectively), which subsequently either disproportionate or react with NOM to form Br-DBPs and iodate/I-DBPs, respectively. The mechanisms of the formation of DBPs in the presence of metal ions and metal oxides (which already exist in water and are released from pipes) and nanoparticles (NPs) (input from the use of consumer products) are then reviewed. Water parameters (pH, cationic and anionic constituents, and types and concentration of NOM) also influence the production of DBPs. Plausible mechanisms of the influence of metal ions on the formation of bromate involve complexation of metal ions with moieties of NOM. Metal oxides catalyze the reactions accountable for the formation of Br-DBPs. Only a few studies have been conducted on the effect of NPs on DBP production during chlorination. More research is needed to understand the variation in NP chemistry under environmental conditions (pH, dissolution, and light), and whether NPs influence DBP formation during chlorination.",Bromate | Brominated compounds | Copper ions | Copper oxide | Iodinated compounds | Mechanism | Oxidation | Silver nanoparticles,76,0,,,,undefined,

However, the direct synthesis of DFF from cheap and abundant carbohydrates via HMF as an intermediate through a one-pot process is highly desirable but challenging. In this work, we have developed a highly efficient and recyclable non-noble heterogeneous catalyst for one-pot conversion of fructose into DFF with extremely high yields (>99%). The catalyst was prepared by a simple pyrolysis method using Fe-based metal-organic frameworks (MOF) as a template and sulfur powder as a dopant. The pyrolysis of the MOF template under interactions of Ostwald ripening and Kirkendall effects led to the formation of uniform octahedral Fe3O4 nanoparticles with exposed (111) crystal facets highly dispersed on sulfur doped carbon. The superior selectivity to DFF over the designed Fe-based catalyst is related to the low adsorption energy of DFF on the support as well as the existence of non-oxidized sulfur that makes the catalytic system less oxidative.",,92,0,,,SKLPPE,2015PT004,Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province

While unplugged catalysts exhibited much better activity for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, the selectivity pattern shifts to the benzoic acid in high yield and selectivity in the presence of plugged catalyst under the exact same reaction conditions. The studies showed for the first time that varying the hydrophobic-hydrophilic balance with concomitant control of plugs in the interior of the mesochannels of the described catalyst enabled tuning of both the catalyst performance and the reaction selectivity, possibly through a cooperative mechanism.

In particular, the CP-MAS NMR, DRIFT, and elemental analysis show that the functional groups were unchanged, without any Si-C bond cleavage in the BFPMO framework during the synthesis and even after surfactant extraction. The extent of plugging in the materials was, as expected, a function of both the hydrolysis rate of the silica and organosilica precursors, as well as the initial methanol concentration. However, for the first time, it was also found that the plugging could be also controlled via the stepwise addition of the silica precursors. This journal is",,24,0,,,,undefined,

Most pretreatments of lignocellulosic biomass into chemicals or biofuels are currently based on expensive chemical and energy consuming processes, which entail significant resource consumption (e.g. water) and generate a number of residual streams. In this work, two innovative dry fractionation technologies (physical fractionation: turbo- and electrostatic separation of lignocellulose particles) have been developed for rice straw ""RS"" fractionation and bioconversion to sugars and biofuels. Turbo-fractionation technology (TF-T) comprises particle separation according to their size and density, whereas electrostatic fractionation technology (EF-T) is based on the separation of particles according to their surface properties (chemical composition and charges). TF-T and EF-T are suitable for producing lignocellulose fractions displaying very different structures, biochemical compositions and reactive surfaces without extensively damaging the raw fibers as well as minimizing waste generation (E-factor: 0.7-0.75). The produced fractions could be hydrolyzed, being able to produce large quantities of glucose (250-280 g kg-1 RS) after 72 h of hydrolysis and subsequently ethanol (130-150 g kg-1 RS) after fermentation. TF-T and EF-T can therefore improve the economic feasibility by low energy consumption and produce reactive lignocellulose particles with different physicochemical structures in a short time, which can be easily converted to biofuels, minimizing waste (no effluent generation).

The selection and design of HDO catalysts plays an important role to determine the success of the process. This review has been aimed to emphasize recent developments on HDO catalysts in effective transformations of biomass-derived platform molecules into hydrocarbon fuels with reduced oxygen content and improved H/C ratios. Liquid hydrocarbon fuels can be obtained by combining oxygen removal processes (e.g. dehydration, hydrogenation, hydrogenolysis, decarbonylation etc.) as well as by increasing the molecular weight via C-C coupling reactions (e.g. aldol condensation, ketonization, oligomerization, hydroxyalkylation etc.).

The nanoparticles were treated with a silane coupling agent to improve their dispersion and interfacial adhesion with the matrix. The morphology, thermal, mechanical, tribological and antibacterial properties of nanocomposites with raw and modified ZnO were comparatively investigated. A progressive rise in the thermal stability and flame retardant ability was found with increasing ZnO loading, the improvements being more pronounced for composites incorporating the coupling agent. The addition of small ZnO contents raised the crystallization temperature and the degree of crystallinity of PEEK, while at higher concentrations the nanoparticles confined the mobility of the polymer chains, hindering the crystal growth. Composites with silane-treated ZnO displayed superior stiffness, strength, ductility, toughness and glass transition temperature with reduced coefficient of friction and wear rate compared to the neat polymer and samples with bare nanoparticles. At a critical concentration of 5.0 wt% of functionalized ZnO, the tensile strength, Young's and storage moduli showed a maximum that coincided with the highest crystallinity and the minimum in the tribological properties.

The reaction was catalysed by different supported metal nanoparticles on mesoporous Al-SBA-15 including -nickel (2, 5 and 10. wt.%), palladium (2. wt.%), platinum (2. wt.%) and ruthenium (2. wt.%). Three main products were indentified in the proposed lignin valorisation protocol, namely a bio-oil, a bio-char and a fraction of residual lignin. These have been characterised by means of several techniques including GC-MS, MALDI-TOF, HPSEC and elemental analysis in order to evaluate the extension and mechanism of the selected depolymerisation approach. In this work, the objective has been the maximisation of bio-oil yield as well as its content in phenolic monomeric compounds. All tested catalysts exhibited improved results as compared to the blank depolymerisation (without catalyst), demonstrating a synergetic effect of metal nanoparticles in lignin hydrogenolysis. The most abundant phenolic products observed in most studied catalysts have been solvent derived products such as diethyl phthalate and butyl-octyl phthalate ester. Interestingly, phenolic compounds derived from lignin were also obtained including mesitol and syringaldehyde as well as desaspidinol and aspidinol, depending on the utilised solvent in the systems. The bio-oil obtained was primarily composed of monomers, dimers and trimers. Biochar yield was relatively high in most cases (>35% in some cases) due to existing oligomerisation reactions under the investigated conditions except for the case of the use of formic acid which gave no biochar in the process. Residual lignin content was often high and repolymerisation was observed in some cases. The catalyst containing 10. wt.% nickel was confirmed to achieve the highest lignin depolymerisation degree, with a maximum yield of 30% bio-oil after a short time of reaction (typically 30. min of microwave irradiation). © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Heterogeneous catalysis | Hydrogenolysis | Lignin depolymerisation | Organosolv lignin,155,0,,,MICINN,CTQ2011 28954-C02-02,Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación

However, one still faces some major challenges for the technology to be fully realized including feedstock costs, novel pretreatment processes, production, transportation, and environmental impact of the full chain. The development of new technologies focused to increase the efficiency of cellulose conversion to biofuels determines successful implementation. Mechanical fractionation is an essential step in order to increase final carbohydrate output, appropriate particle sizes and densification, enzymatic accessibility, and bioconversion affectivity without the production of toxic side streams. In this review article, we surveyed a substantial amount of previous work in mechanical fractionation or pretreatments of a variety of lignocellulosic biomasses; these include numerous milling schemes and extrusions, and their impacts on the physical and physicochemical properties of the lignocellulosic matrix (crystallinity, surface area, particle size, etc). We have also compared results with other pure chemical and physicochemical pretreatments in order to show the new aspects and advantages/disadvantages of such an approach. Last, but not least, the effect of mechanical treatment and physical properties on enzymatic hydrolysis and bioconversion has been discussed, with potentially interesting dry lignocellulosic biorefinery schemes proposed.

The synthesized materials were hydrothermally treated at various temperatures (70, 100 and 130°C) and subsequently calcined at 600, 800 and 1000°C. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), Wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXRD), Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and N2 adsorption-desorption experiments have been used to characterize the mesoporous materials, which were subsequently evaluated in terms of photocatalytic efficiency. The results show that hydrothermal and calcination temperatures can change surface area, phase composition as well as degree of crystallinity dramatically resulting in varying photocatalytic performance. Although higher hydrothermal and calcination temperatures will result in lower surface area, a higher degree of crystallinity can be achieved which lead to improved photocatalytic properties.

Food waste valorization is one of the current research areas that has attracted a great deal of attention over the past few years as a potential alternative to the disposal of a wide range of residues in landfill sites. In particular, the development of environmentally sound and innovative strategies to process such waste is an area of increasing importance in our current society. Landfill, incineration and composting are common, mature technologies for waste disposal. However, they are not satisfactory to treating organic waste due to the generation of toxic methane gas and bad odor, high energy consumption and slow reaction kinetics. In fact, research efforts have also been oriented on novel technologies to decompose organic waste. However, no valuable product is generated from the decomposition process. Instead of disposing and decomposing food waste, recent research has focused on its utilization as energy source (e.g., for bioethanol and biodiesel production). Organic waste is also useful to generate useful organic chemicals via biorefinery or white biotechnology (e.g., succinic acid and/or bio-plastics). This article is aimed to summarize recent development of waste valorization strategies for the sustainable production of chemicals, materials, and fuels through the development of green production strategies. It will also provide key insights into recent legislation on management of waste worldwide as well as two relevant case studies (the transformation of corncob residues into functionalized biomass-derived carbonaceous solid acids and their utilization in the production of biodiesel-like biofuels from waste oils in Philippines, as well as the development of a bakery waste based biorefinery for succinic acid and bioplastic production in Hong Kong) to illustrate the enormous potential of biowaste valorization for a more sustainable society.

It involves ultrafiltration as a fractionation process to separate different molecular weight lignin fractions followed by a hydrogen-free, mild, hydrogenolytic, heterogeneously catalyzed methodology assisted by microwave irradiation to obtain simple phenolic, monomeric products by depolymerization using a nickel-based catalyst. The main products obtained were desaspidinol, syringaldehyde, and syringol; this proves the efficiency of the depolymerization conditions applied. The concentration of these observed compounds increased when the molecular weights of the lignin fractions increased. The applied depolymerization conditions, which take advantage of the use of formic acid as a hydrogen-donating solvent, did not generate any biochar in the systems.

A multidisciplinary approach is needed to produce suitable alternatives—such as renewable resources—for a more sustainable future. One of the most promising and widely available renewable feedstocks is biomass, which has significant potential for conversion to materials, fuels, and chemicals. In addition, nanomaterials can be designed for a range of applications including energy storage, fuel production, and nanocatalysis. Designing nanomaterials for the valorization of biomass and waste feedstocks is a major step in advancing the application of nanomaterials and helping to move us toward the goal of a sustainable economy. Producing Fuels and Fine Chemicals from Biomass Using Nanomaterials offers a wide-ranging approach to the development of innovative nanomaterials for biomass conversion and the production of energy and high-added-value chemicals, including biochemicals, biomaterials, and biofuels. The book is organized into three parts according to nanomaterial applications: Nanomaterials for Energy Storage and Conversion, Biofuels from Biomass Valorization Using Nanomaterials, and Production of High-Added-Value Chemicals from Biomass Using Nanomaterials. Providing a multidisciplinary perspective, this book covers the most important aspects of topics such as solar energy storage, design of carbonaceous nanomaterials as heterogeneous catalysts for producing biofuels, catalytic reforming of biogas into syngas using a range of nanoparticles, and biofuels production from waste oils and fats. It also describes the design and development of biocatalytic, solid acid, photocatalytic, and nanostructured materials for the conversion of various biomass feedstocks to valuable chemicals as intermediates to end products, such as biopolymers, bioplastics, biofuels, agrochemicals, and pharmaceutical products.",,11,0,,,,undefined,

Our society is currently experiencing constraints imposed by our resource system, which drives industry to increase its overall efficiency by improving existing processes or finding new uses for waste. Food supply chain waste emerged as a resource with a significant potential to be employed as a raw material for the production of fuels and chemicals given the abundant volumes globally generated, its contained diversity of functionalised chemical components and the opportunity to be utilised for higher value applications. The present manuscript is aimed to provide a general overview of the current and most innovative uses of food supply chain waste, providing a range of worldwide case-studies from around the globe. These studies will focus on examples illustrating the use of citrus peel, waste cooking oil and cashew shell nut liquid in countries such as China, the UK, Tanzania, Spain, Greece or Morocco. This work emphasises 2<sup>nd</sup> generation food waste valorisation and re-use strategies for the production of higher value and marketable products rather than conventional food waste processing (incineration for energy recovery, feed or composting) while highlighting issues linked to the use of food waste as a sustainable raw material. The influence of food regulations on food supply chain waste valorisation will also be addressed as well as our society's behavior towards food supply chain waste.

COG, which is used as fuel in different processes of the steelmaking plants, is a H2-rich gas with a high energetic potential. However, there is a significant surplus that usually is burnt away in torches, and even directly emitted into the air.

Microwave-assisted heating is particularly interesting because it offers improved conversions (and often seletivities to target products) under milder conditions at remarkably reduced times of reaction for a wide range of conventional reactions. In this chapter we aim to explore several asymmetric syntheses carried out under microwave irradiation, giving a general overview of recently developments in this field. Significant rate enhancements, a decrease of chiral catalyst loading and higher enantioselectivities are the key achievement of microwave activation protocols. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Arthrospira platensis (Spirulina) is known for its nutritional benefits with very low lipid content. However, among all other algae, spirulina is the most easy to cultivate due to its inherent resistance to contamination and environmental changes. The presented work aims to determine the best culture medium to achieve an optimum lipid content for microalgae in view of a subsequent exploration for biodiesel production. This was conducted by means of a two step microalgal oil extraction followed by a conventional acid-catalysed esterification of the released fatty acids. Algal growth, biomass and lipid content were compared for Spirulina grown under six different culture media. 1) culture medium of complete nutrition (CONTROL); 2) nitrogen and phosphorus-deprived [NP(-)]; 3) nitrogen-deprived [N(-)]; 4) phosphorus-deprived [P(-)]; 5) nitrogen and phosphorus-limited [NPL] and; 6) nitrogen-deprived and phosphorus-limited [N(-)PL]. With the minimum possible dried biomass (0.4780 g L -1), the largest lipid content (ca. 20%) was achieved in spirulina grown under nitrogen-deprived and phosporous-limited conditions [N(-)PL]. Dried biomass from Spirulina grown under two opposite culture media: complete nutrition [CONTROL]; and nitrogen and phosphorous deprived [NP(-)], were utilised for biodiesel preparation after oil extraction. A crude biodiesel yield of 40% and 42%, with a FAME content of 69% and 55% were obtained for CONTROL and NP(-) samples, respectively. Interestingly, the nutrient condition of Spirulina did influence biodiesel yields but not significantly their FAME compositions, which comprised of mostly C16:0 and C18:2, similar to that of conventional biodiesel. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,15,0,,,,undefined,

The potential of utilizing waste as a new resource and the development of integrated facilities producing multiple products from biomass is discussed under the guise of biorefineries. Biofuels are discussed in depth, as they not only provide fuel (energy) but are also a source of feedstock chemicals.

This contribution is devoted to guide experimental chemists through calculations that some years ago were reserved to theoretical specialists. The widespread availability of fast computers enables nowadays studies of complex compounds (e.g. metallacarboranes) from different perspectives including simulation of NMR, infrared or Raman spectra and calculation of other properties such as atomic charges or inter-/intramolecular interactions. The insights gained on the basis of theoretical calculations are crucial for either finding novel or improving existing applications of metallacarboranes. For example, in the case of enzyme inhibitors, the interactions of the metallacarboranes with the surrounding protein and how the interaction affects the efficiency are difficult problems to study experimentally. The use of theoretical tools can provide a detailed understanding of the physico-chemical basis of the interactions and thus offers a chance to control the overall process.© 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,113,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

In contrast to the chosen reaction temperature, reaction time and stirring efficiency are of critical importance in the preparation of these supported nanoparticles.

The development of new generations of biodiesel, aimed at more sustainable and effective feedstock utilisation alongside improved production efficiency and fuel quality, is critical to the future both of this industry and of the continuing use of biodiesel fuels in transportation. This book provides a timely reference on the advances in the development of biodiesel fuels, production processes and technologies. Part one reviews the life cycle sustainability assessment and socio-economic and environmental policy issues associated with advanced biodiesel production, as well as feedstocks and fuel quality standards. This coverage is extended in Part two, with chapters focussing on the development of methods and catalysts essential to the improvement and optimisation of biodiesel production processes and technologies. With its distinguished editors and international team of contributors, Advances in biodiesel production a standard reference for chemical, biochemical and industrial process engineers, as well as scientists and researchers in this important field. © 2012 Woodhead Publishing Limited.

The discovery that most tissues and cells in the body have a vitamin D receptor and that several possess the enzymatic machinery to convert the primary circulating form of vitamin D (25-hydroxycholecalciferol, hydroxylated vitamin D3) to the active form (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, calcitriol) has provided new insights into the function of this vitamin.

Biomass is considered by experts the only sustainable source of energy and organic carbon for our industrial society, and it has the potential to displace petroleum in the production of chemicals and liquid transportation fuels. However, the transition from a petroleum-based economy to one based on biomass requires new strategies since the petrochemical technologies, well-developed over the last century, are not valid to process the biomass-derived compounds. Unlike petroleum feedstocks, biomass derived platform molecules possess a high oxygen content that gives them low volatility, high solubility in water, high reactivity and low thermal stability, properties that favour the processing of these resources by catalytic aqueous-phase technologies at moderate temperatures. This tutorial review is aimed at providing a general overview of processes, technologies and challenges that lie ahead for a range of different aqueous-phase transformations of some of the key biomass-derived platform molecules into liquid fuels for the transportation sector and related high added value chemicals. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,716,0,,,,undefined,

An alternative raw material for chemicals and biofuels production is lignocellulosic biomass. The conversion of biomass to biofuels begins with biomass pretreatment in which chemical and/or physical treatments are utilised to remove or weaken the tight linkages among cell-wall components, making biomass easier to degrade. The use of ionic liquids-salts (mixtures of cations and anions that melt below 100 °C) has been described as a new potentially viable development in this area due to the increasing interest in the use of such compounds to pretreat lignocellulosic materials and to catalyse the dissolution of cellulose. This manuscript aims to provide an overview on the major representative progress and development of the use of ionic liquids systems for biomass pretreatment and cellulose dissolution. A comparison of the environmental impact of different ionic liquids for the conversion of carbohydrates into useful biofuel intermediates will be described, with their inherent advantages for biomass valorisation processes in terms of unique and tuneable physico-chemical properties. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,400,0,,,,undefined,

In this work, an inexpensive purified 1,3-specific lipase from Thermomyces lanuginosus (Lipopan 50 BG from Novozymes AS, Denmark) was utilised as biocatalyst in an alternative approach to obtain a novel second generation biodiesel-like biofuel. This novel product, which integrates glycerol as monoacylglycerols (MG) into the biofuels composition, can avoid the removal step/s of such byproduct, mandatory in the production of conventional biodiesel. A multi-factorial design and response surface methodology (RSM) were employed to evaluate the effects of several conditions (temperature, molar ratio of ethanol to oil and pH) on the conversion of sunflower oil into a blend of Fatty Acid Ethyl Esters (FAEE), MG and diacylglycerols (DG). The effects of water content and concentration of lipase on conversion into FAEE and MG were also studied. Results obtained indicate that pH, molar ratio of ethanol to oil and water content were significant factors influencing the conversion in the systems under the investigated conditions. Low temperatures (20 °C), high pH values (close to 12), and an oil/ethanol volume ratios of 3.4/1 were found to be the key controlling parameters which provide optimised results after 1 h reaction (conversions around 70%; kinematic viscosities about 8.5 mm2 s-1). © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The possibility of replacing a semi-defined medium with fresh water by wheat-derived media with natural seawater was carried out sequentially. Results showed that besides the usage as a water source, seawater also can be used as a mineral supplement to the wheat-derived media, forming a nutrient-complete medium for succinic acid production.

Most research related to mussels has dwelt on different topics as fine-scale, intra-drainage distribution patterns and life history traits relevant to applied conservation and propagation issues but there are only a few reports on anatomy studies. This chapter provides baseline reference material regarding the anatomy of Unionidae freshwater mussels, focusing in particular on the subfamily Unioninae with the aim to improve the knowledge in mussels of professional biologists and amateur naturalists as well as their preservation. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Jatropha seeds are rich sources of hydrocarbons (27.0 to 48.5 % oil content) and the kernels can yield 46-58% of semidry oil. Information on various biofuel feedstocks indicate this non-edible oilseed plant could be converted to efficient biofuel crops by biotechnologically rendering it less toxic. A major concern for the extended use of jatropha seems to be the lack of knowledge on its potential yield under sub-optimal and marginal conditions. The introduction of jatropha for varied purposed faced a limited success due to unreliable seeds and oils yields and low economic returns. Despite considerable investments and project being undertaken in many countries, there is a lack of reliable scientific data on the agronomy of jatropha with poorly documented information on relationship among yields and variables including soil, climate, crops management and genetic material is poorly documented. In this work, we report a series of biotechnological methodologies to selection, in vitro propagation and plant breeding of jatropha curcas for the sustainable production of biodiesel. An overview of the currently available information on the different research on the production of biodiesel using jatropha al raw material is also given in terms of catalysts and possible non-edible feedstocks to be utilised in the process. The most promising methodology may be the use of biocatalysts with the addition of acyl acceptors different to short alcohols because this addresses the problem by opening the possibility of obtaining a second generation of biodiesel that integrates glycerol into the biofuels composition. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Such products are ecologically ""ethical"" and are effective and safe to use. Vitamin E is the main lipophilic antioxidant that inhibits peroxidation, especially if associated with ""natural"" moisturizers such as the lipids in olive oil and olive extract. Vegetable oils containing EFAs have proven to be of great use in the production of cosmetics as either active incipient or raw materials for the synthesis of novel compounds. EFAs are easily integrated into the skin's hydro-lipid film and are nourishing, moisturizing, and protective. Some of these substances have been used for centuries yet can still meet the needs of today's consumers. Apart from their moisturizing and soothing effects, and anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory function, these products reduce aging of the skin with their antioxidant, stabilizing action on the cellular membranes. Treatment with olive oil has no side effects. Olive oil does not burn or traumatize the skin. Several synthetic compounds have been used in the development of cosmetics to adulterate the many essential oils derived from natural sources; however, lessons must be learned from the previous failures of organic chemistry. Environmentally polluting chemicals approved by the Department of Transportation (DOT) were initially claimed to be safe. Several pharmaceutical drugs have been licensed only to be subsequently withdrawn due to their serious side effects. These failures demonstrate that although chemical principles may be useful in the development of synthetic cosmetics, the potential for serious side effects must be considered. © 2010 Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Its desirable criteria include high selectivity, being compatible with many types of functional groups, typical use without protection groups and strong bases, and introduction at relatively late stages of the total synthesis. However, its use is less common in large-scale manufacture due to their cost and availability of aromatic halides at scale. In addition, palladium contamination of pharmaceutical products has to be 10 ppm or less that is difficult to achieve without strenuous and typically wastefully remediation strategies in place.

SA crystals were successfully recovered from fermentation broths (FB) using this method. A higher SA crystal purity (95%) and yield (70%) were obtained in the direct crystallisation method compared to a slightly modified traditional calcium precipitation method (90% and 24%, respectively). Chemical transformations (e.g. esterifications) to high-added value derivatives of both recovered SA crystals were then investigated using a range of solid acids including our acidic tunable mesoporous carbonaceous materials denoted as Starbon® acids. Results showed that SA crystals could be successfully converted into mono- and diesters in high yields and selectivities employing solid acids regardless of the reaction conditions. The order of reactivity was found to be: pure SA crystals > SA crystals from defined FB > FB SA crystals. Results demonstrate that SA can be effectively purified from actual fermentation broths, showing the importance of integrating the fermentation and downstream processing to optimise the fermentative production of SA and its chemical transformations to produce high-added value derivatives. © 2009 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,89,0,,,EPSRC,EP/C007484/1,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council

While Pd containing films without MPTMS were highly active and reusable after 3 runs, MPTMS containing films were found to be inactive after the first use.

In particular, those from the Mytilidae species are of great interest because biochemical investigations have shown that they can be sources of biological active substances which can have different applications (e.g. food additives). We report here the extraction of lipids from two different species of molluscs (Mytilus galloprovincialis L., Mediterranean mussel) and gastropods (Rapana venosa, hard-shell clam). The extracts were evaluated in terms of antioxidant and composition properties and their healing properties were tested on skin burns in Wistar rats. Our studies proved that the two lipid extracts contained a relatively complex distribution of compounds, in terms of characteristic indices, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and vitamins E and D. The presence of such compounds rendered the extracts very efficient in healing induced skin burns in Wistar rats. The histological analysis showed a reduction in the time of healing (12-13 and 13-15 days for the Mytilus galloprovincialis (L.)

In this contribution, we follow the mechanism of templated synthesis of mesoporous silica in the nonfunctionalized parent system, for different ACN/water proportions. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) of spin probes was employed to follow structural changes in the template structure during precipitation, while X-ray diffraction (XRD) and porosimetry determinations have in parallel reported on the time evolution of the mesoporous structure. Three solvent mixtures were studied, with largely different solvent compositions, and EPR data have shown that a 0.3 M dodecylamine (DDA) solution in (i) ACN/water =1/1 v/v was a true micellar solution, in (ii) ACN/water = 2/8 v/v was a biphasic system with a lamellar liquid crystalline phase, and in (iii) ACN/water = 8/2 was a molecular solution. In spite of these extreme differences, after 20 min reaction with TEOS, all compositions presented a well-developed mesoporous structure with similar pore dimensions. In case i, the mechanism of precipitation on preformed micelles is straightforward. In case ii, EPR of spin probes has provided evidence that tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) addition leads to an immediate phase transformation of the liquid crystalline phase to a micellar solution, on which silica precipitation occurs. Compared with i and ii, no DDA aggregates were found in solution before or during precipitation for the third solvent mixture iii, pointing to a true cooperative mechanism. XRD and nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements entirely support these data. Interestingly, the precipitate formed in the first 5 min was nonstructured for all systems, even for i where preformed micelles were present. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,5,0,,,,undefined,

Materials were tested in the N-methylation of aniline with methanol. The aniline methylation was a pseudo-first-order process with respect to aniline concentration. N-Methylation products [N-methylaniline (NMA) and N,N-dimethylaniline (NNDMA)] were predominant with a 65-80% selectivity to NMA at 573 K. Low reaction temperatures favoured the N-alkylation pathway whereas high temperatures produced higher quantities of C-alkylated products. Aniline conversion and selectivity to NNDMA decreased whereas selectivity to NMA continuously increased with time on stream. Selectivity to NMA remained almost the same, irrespective of the aniline conversion, aluminum content and acidity. On the other hand, the re-used Al-MCM-41 catalysts would be described as amorphous aluminosilicates because of their structural deterioration with the water produced in the reaction as a by-product. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Three synthesis procedures were compared: (i) direct synthesis by using tetraethyl orthosilicate as the silica source, boric acid as the boron source and the surfactant cetyl-trimethylammonium bromide, (ii) direct synthesis with a post-synthesis treatment in NH4F solution and (iii) capillary impregnation of mesoporous Si-MCM-41. The solid structures were analysed by XRD, N2 adsorption, TG-DTA and DRIFT. The surface acidity was determined by TPD and DRIFT by using pyridine as the probe molecule. Furthermore, the presence of acid and basic sites was shown from the conversion of 2-methyl-3-butyn-2-ol. This study indicated that samples obtained by direct synthesis had both acid and basic properties, while fluorinated samples had mainly acid properties and those synthesised by capillary impregnation exhibited predominantly basic properties. Likewise, an increase in boron content produced a decrease in both the intensity of the XRD peaks and BET surface area as well as an increase in total acidity. In the absence of deactivation processes (pulse method), at 573 K, silicates and borosilicates MCM-41 catalysed the formation of by-products of ε-caprolactam, although this process was favoured on solids with mainly basic properties. Under continuous flow reaction conditions, at 723 K, results indicated that the incorporation of boron to the Si-MCM-41 framework did not affect the activity and product distribution. Finally, when acetonitrile was used as the solvent in a continuous flow system, although selectivity to ε-caprolactam improved, the by-products of ε-caprolactam adsorption were also favoured resulting in the deterioration of catalyst life. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Often, the homocoupling reactions of substituted acetylenic derivatives are concomitant to the Sonogashira pathway and time-consuming optimization procedures are required in order to reach satisfactory levels of selectivity. In this paper, the potential of a class of Pd-complexes loaded to mesoporous silica gel in promoting the Sonogashira reaction between aryl acetylenes and iodoarenes is underlined. This family of heterogeneous organo-palladium systems allows the desired cross-coupled compounds to be isolated in excellent yield under very mild conditions. In fact, the absence of organic solvents, copper(I) co-catalyst and phosphane ligands, (which are easily oxidisable and whose preparation has a heavy environmental impact), in conjunction with the low catalyst loading ([Pd] 0.1-1 mol%) and its recoverability, stresses the environmental benefits of the protocol. The Sonogashira/homocoupling selectivity proved to be function of the haloarene employed. As a matter of fact, while iodoarenes bearing EWG (electron withdrawing groups) on the phenyl ring underwent smoothly the Sonogashira pathway, electron-rich iodobenzenes showed opposite behaviour by mainly furnishing the homocoupling product. The use of bromoarenes provided solely the homocoupling product in excellent yield without themselves being consumed. This is despite that fact that the catalysts used activate bromoarenes equally as well as iodoarenes in both Heck and Suzuki systems. Kinetic investigations revealed a highly temperature-dependent profile, which indicates strongly that the reaction takes place at the surface. Finally, the full heterogeneous character of the catalytically active species as well as the reusability of the immobilised Pd-complex were confirmed by hot-filtration test and by multiple reuses of the supported catalyst in subsequent Sonogashira cross-couplings. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The benefits of using this system compared to aqueous ethanol to prepare silicas are the much enhanced wall thickness, leading to greater structural stability, as well as a lack of co-surfactancy from acetonitrile, which means that the pore size remains constant over a wide range of solvent compositions. The particles obtained from this route are cylindrical, with partially aligned mesopores, in contrast to those obtained from aqueous ethanol, which are spherical and have a wormhole structure. A further major advantage is that the amine-functionalised materials, formed by direct co-condensation, are nucleophilic, in contrast to those prepared from aqueous ethanol. This latter feature allows for the elaboration of these amine functions to attach a range of more complex functionality, examples of which are given. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2005.",,14,0,,,,undefined,

TG/DTA, XRD, and laser-Raman spectroscopy showed that the method assisted by an organic additive resulted in AlPO4 with higher thermal stabilities (crystallization was delayed), as well as high surface areas and pore volumes even after calcination at 1073/1273 K. In all cases, 27Al and 31P MAS NMR spectroscopy only indicated the formation of tetrahedral Al-(OP)4 and P(OAl)4 units. Moreover, surface areas and pore volumes depended on the organic additive used. Thus, the AlPO4 obtained in the presence of 1,3-propanediol and 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol possessed higher thermal stabilities that resulted in larger surface areas and pore volumes. Surface acidity measurements, through chemisorption (measured by gaschromatography) of pyridine and 2,6-dimethylpyridine at 473-573 K, indicated that the AlPO4 obtained in the presence of 1,3-propanediol and 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol exhibited surface acid sites even after calcination at 1273 K. Cyclohexene skeletal isomerization, which is a model reaction catalyzed by relatively strong acid sites, was also studied for further characterization of acidic properties. Good correlations between catalytic performance and acidic properties were found.",,74,0,,,,undefined,
