    "\n",
    "An **Application Programming Interface** or **API** is a set of protocols that allow software applications to communicate with each other. They allow developers to integrate data, services and capabilities from other applications. Application owners often create APIs to make their data and functions available to others. \n",
    "\n",
    "While there are different types of APIs, the most commonly used today are web APIs that allow an application owner to share their application's functionality or data over the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an in-depth explanation and demonstration of how APIs work, please see the [APIs in Python](https://git.dartmouth.edu/lib-digital-strategies/RDS/workshops/computational-tools/apis-in-python) workshop materials, created by Research Data Service's Simon Stone."

    "Bibliometric platforms like the Web of Science, Scopus, Dimensions, Semantic Scholar, OpenCitations, and others allow researchers (with institutional access!) to access their large databases. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, what if you need to retrieve large amounts of data from these datasets? Frequently retrieve updated bibliometric data? Quickly perform multi-step searches (i.e. search for a list of authors, retrieve all documents they (co-)authored, and then retrieve info about documents those documents cited...)?\n",
    "\n",
    "For these cases, using the platforms' APIs may save you a lot of time and energy.\n",
